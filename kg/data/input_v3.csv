https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68442842,"Super Tuesday: What is it and why is it important?
","Super Tuesday, the biggest day so far in the 2024 race for the White House, is upon us.

On 5 March, voters in 15 states and one US territory choose candidates for president.

While in a sixteenth state, we'll also get the Democrats' results.

It should offer a glimpse of Joe Biden and Donald Trump's strengths and potential weaknesses as the two bitter rivals hurtle towards a rematch in November's general election.

What is Super Tuesday and which states are voting?
It's when most states vote in the presidential primary calendar.

Nominating contests will be held in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.
Four things to watch out for on Super Tuesday
The Republican contest will be in all of these 15 states, while the Democrats will vote in the same states except Alaska. They will hold caucuses, too, in American Samoa.

We'll also get the results of the Democratic contest in Iowa, which has been ongoing by post for several weeks.

How many delegates are up for grabs?
Based on the result of each contest, party officials known as delegates are awarded to the top candidates. A certain number of delegates is needed to formally anoint the nominee at each party's convention this summer.

About one-third of total delegates - 865 Republican and at least 1,420 Democratic - are up for grabs on Super Tuesday.

The Trump campaign has projected he will win at least 773 delegates on the day and clinch the nomination later in March. He currently has an estimated 244 delegates, while his Republican rival, Nikki Haley, has 43.

A minimum of 1,215 delegates are needed to win the Republican nomination, while 1,968 is the magic number for the Democrats.

What's at stake for Trump?
With a double-digit lead in the polls, the Republican front-runner will be hoping to finally knock his last remaining rival out of the race.

Former UN envoy Ms Haley is still standing despite only racking up a single win in a string of nominating votes so far and deep-pocketed donors closing their wallets.

Although she has no clear path to victory, Super Tuesday may be her last chance to impede Mr Trump's momentum, or expose his potential vulnerabilities heading into the general election.

In some contests to date, Mr Trump has struggled to win over college-educated suburbanites - a demographic that could ultimately thwart his dream of a White House comeback.

What about Biden?
The Democratic president is all but certain to seal his party's nomination, despite long-shot challenges from congressman Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson.

The Biden campaign had a setback in Michigan on 27 February when 13% of voters declared themselves ""uncommitted"" amid a campaign to register a protest ballot over the president's support for Israel.

Last-minute campaigns are being cobbled together for similar protest votes in other states on Super Tuesday. California, Colorado, North Carolina, Minnesota and Vermont are among the states where such efforts are underway.

More broadly, exit poll data from across the country could reveal whether an enthusiasm gap among key blocs, including younger voters, poses a challenge for his re-election bid.

When will we know the result?
With votes happening in six time zones, the final outcome will not immediately be known.

Results will start trickling in as polls close on the east coast in the early evening.

US networks, including the BBC's US partner CBS News, are expected to begin calling states from around 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT).

Which are the other contests to watch?
Eyes will be on North Carolina, the only general election battleground voting on Tuesday. Mr Trump beat Mr Biden there in 2020 by just over a single percentage point.

Following a Supreme Court ruling, Mr Trump remains on the ballot in Colorado and Maine, despite both states trying to disqualify him on the grounds of allegedly inciting insurrection.

A potential wildcard is that several states are completely open to voters regardless of party registration. One is Virginia, where Republican voters have a relatively moderate reputation.

The Old Dominion state might be Ms Haley's best hope of a consolation on what is projected to be a tough night for her.",3/5/2024,Jude Sheerin,BBC News,United Kingdom

President Joe Biden raised a single-day record $10 million (£7.7 million) within 24 hours of his State of the Union Speech on Thursday.
Making around a quarter of all funds raised for the Democrats in a month, in one day, the Biden-Harris campaign made good on their goal of ramping up funds ahead of the upcoming election.

Biden's campaign brought in a total $42 million overall in the month of January meaning there was a total $56 million in the bank by the end of the month.

As Super Tuesday saw Trump sweep the polls in the Republican primaries, it is now near guaranteed that Trump and Biden will go head to head once again in the upcoming elections.

On Thursday Biden went to Capitol Hill for his last State of the Union address before Congress of his first term. According to a senior advisor, following his speech, the next day 113,000 contributions were made to Biden's campaign funds as part of a wider number of 116,000 donations over the 24 hours.

Former President Donald Trump’s political operation amassed about $130 million in the final months of last year but after spending heavily, headed into 2024 with more than $42 million to start the election year.

Biden received little recognition from Republican lawmakers but his remarks were popular with Democrats. The funds have already been invested in a $30 million advertisement used across swing states to promote Biden’s campaign. Biden also followed his speech by visiting more swing states to speak, making trips to both Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Atlanta, Georgia over the weekend.
In the clip, Biden acknowledges his age, a factor that has come under fire from the Republicans, and emphasises this life experience makes him a good presidential candidate. Similarly at the State of the Union address, he claimed at 81 years of age he is able to “get things done.”

After Super Tuesday, Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee especially after his remaining competitor, Nikki Haley, suspended her campaign on Wednesday.
Biden’s speech was briefly interrupted by the father of a Marine killed in Afghanistan. Steve Nikoui, who has now been arrested, shouted at the President as he said: ""America is safer today than when I took office"". Mr Nikoui then interrupted Biden's speech from the chamber's balcony to yell: “Abbey Gate! Second Battalion, First Marines!""
Capitol Police then escorted the 51-year-old out of the chamber at around 10.15pm and took him into custody. He was charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding Congress, a misdemeanour that usually sees the offender released after paying a $50 fine.

https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-tackles-criticism-his-age-head-1877677,Joe Biden Tackles Criticism of His Age Head-On,"President Joe Biden has taken on concerns about his age head-on in a new campaign ad and social media post as his reelection campaign begins to accelerate.

While they have yet to be formally declared the presumptive nominees, Biden and former President Donald Trump are the overwhelming favorites to secure the 2024 nominations for the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, setting up a 2020 rematch in November's general election. In recent months, polls for the hypothetical match-up have overall averaged out to show the two candidates neck-and-neck with voters. Republican opponents of the president have, in turn, attempted to position age as a key argument against Biden's presidency, citing some instances in speeches where he appears to flub lines or mix-up terms. Some have even gone so far as to allege that he is secretly suffering from senility or dementia. Supporters of Biden have countered these claims, highlighting the president's numerous accomplishments and noting Trump's own age-related struggles. Trump is only four years younger than Biden, and opponents have cited numerous recent instances of slurred speech, mispronunciation, and mixed-up names in public addresses and rallies to argue that his cognitive health is worse than his Democratic rival.

As Biden's reelection begins to accelerate heading into the spring, he has taken on the concerns about his age head-on, in a Sunday post to the official presidential account on X, formerly Twitter, and in a new campaign ad. In the new ad that was released on Saturday, Biden begins by stating, ""I'm not a young guy. That's no secret. But, here's the deal. I understand how to get things done for the American people."" The president then proceeds to lay out the various high-profile accomplishments of his first term, including the passage of a major infrastructure bill, lowering prescription drug costs, capping insulin prices for seniors, and leading the U.S. pandemic recovery efforts.

The vid eo also ends on a humorous note, with Biden questioning the need for an ad addressing concerns about his age in a bit presented as coming in response for a request to do one more take.

""Look, I'm very young, energetic, and handsome!"" Biden says in the ad. ""What the hell am I doing this for?""

Newsweek reached out to the Biden campaign via email on Sunday for comment. Any responses received will be added to this story in a later update.

As he was 78 at the time of his inauguration in January 2021, Biden is the oldest individual in U.S. history to hold the office of the presidency. Throughout his term, concerns about his advanced age have persisted among voters, who have frequently told pollsters they believe he is too old to be president and that he should not run for a second term, despite there being little to no historical precedent for such a move.",3/10/2024,Thomas Kika,Newsweek,United States
https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/20/politics/barack-obama-joe-biden-donald-trump-obamacare/index.html,"Biden and Obama look to capitalize on Trump’s latest threats to repeal Obamacare
","President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama will team up to rally supporters around the Affordable Care Act’s 14th anniversary this weekend as Democrats make their latest move to capitalize on former President Donald Trump’s threats to repeal Obamacare.

Biden and Obama, along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will hold a national organizing call on Saturday to mobilize supporters “around protecting the ACA from Trump’s attacks,” a campaign official said. The call is part of a weekend of action to rally voters around the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature accomplishment, which the former president signed into law on March 23, 2010.

It comes as the campaign has been eager to make health care a key issue in the 2024 campaign after Trump resurrected talk of repealing Obamacare if he secures a second term in the White House.

Although the Affordable Care Act became law without Republican support, and the GOP spent much of the remainder of Obama’s time in office trying to repeal it, the law has surged in popularity since Trump took office in 2017. Biden campaign officials believe preserving the law is a potent political issue, as Obamacare sign-ups for 2024 coverage hit a record 21.3 million.

Trump vowed to repeal the law when he became president but failed to do so – in large part because neither he nor congressional Republicans had a solid replacement health care plan. The last major repeal measure failed in Congress in the first year of Trump’s term, when the late Sen. John McCain joined Democrats and a few other Republicans in ending the effort.

That was around the last time the law was viewed unfavorably by more Americans than favorably. Today, a near record 59% of Americans view the Affordable Care Act favorably, according to KFF, a nonpartisan research group.

More than 40 million Americans now have health care coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, up from just under 27 million in 2017, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Biden and advocates for the landmark health reform law are also highlighting its other key benefits, including protecting those with pre-existing conditions from being charged more by insurers, offering free preventive care, including cancer screenings, cholesterol tests and annual checkups, providing increased access to mental health and substance abuse treatment through Medicaid and allowing children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26.

Trump once again talks of repeal
The Affordable Care Act would be far harder to repeal today since it is more embedded in the nation’s health care system than it was in 2017.

Nevertheless, Trump last year began renewing his vows to repeal the act in his latest run for the White House – to the surprise and dismay of some of his own advisers.

“We’re gonna fight for much better health care than Obamacare,” Trump said in a speech in Newton, Iowa earlier this year. “Obamacare is a catastrophe. Nobody talks about it. You know, without John McCain, we would have had it done.”

Biden’s campaign plans to hold more than 20 in-person events in battleground states with local elected officials and individuals benefiting from the health care law starting on Thursday. There will also be an advertising and social media push around the anniversary.

The call marks the latest collaboration between Biden and his former boss in the 2024 campaign. They released a video last year vowing to protect and expand Obamacare amid threats from Trump, and Obama has helped with some of the campaign’s fundraising appeals.

Biden and Obama also are set to appear together in-person next Thursday for a New York City fundraiser featuring the two presidents and former President Bill Clinton.",3/20/2024,"Arlette Saenz, Michael Williams and Tami Luhby,",CNN,United States
https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/15/biden-trump-corrupt-poll/,"Partisans are equally likely to say the other candidate is ‘too corrupt’
","One of the most remarkable findings from Yahoo News’s new poll is not exactly a new one.

Respondents to the poll, conducted by YouGov, were asked whether they thought a set of concerns applied to President Biden or Donald Trump. Was either of the two general-election candidates too extreme on the issues to be president? Too corrupt? Too incompetent? Too dangerous?


These are broad terms, certainly, allowing for those wanting to express distaste for a candidate to make them fit if they wished. But even given that malleability, it is striking that the difference in views of either candidate as “too corrupt” — not just corrupt, but disqualifyingly corrupt — is so modest.

About 4 in 10 respondents said that was true of Trump, while a third of respondents said so of Biden — a single-digit gap, despite a much wider gap in the number of criminal indictments and impeachments applied to the two candidates.

In general, Americans expressed more concern about Trump than Biden, albeit not by wide margins. Respondents were more likely to say that Trump was too extreme, too corrupt and too dangerous. Only on the “too incompetent” question did a larger percentage identify Biden.


Interestingly, those patterns held even when looking at partisan subgroups. Trump was more likely to be viewed as “too extreme” even by his own party than Biden was by his. Biden was more likely to be viewed as “too incompetent” by the opposing party than Trump was by Democrats.

What’s also interesting is how these numbers have shifted over time.

Yahoo and YouGov asked the same questions in May. Then, the gap between Biden and Trump on the “too corrupt” question was in the double digits, while “too incompetent” was in the single digits. Since then, the “corrupt” gap narrowed and the “incompetent” gap widened — thanks largely to shifts among Republicans.


The share of Republicans saying Biden is too corrupt jumped 12 percentage points, unquestionably because of the investigations and impeachment effort from congressional Republicans. That helped close the overall gap between the two candidates, just as the increase in Republicans saying that Biden is “too incompetent” helped expand the overall gap. Among Democrats, there was no change in the percentage saying Biden was too incompetent.

On both “too corrupt” and “too incompetent,” the gap between Biden and Trump shifted by 10 points to Biden’s disadvantage among all respondents.

This has long been an obvious if quiet aim of the Republican effort to target Biden: convince Republicans dubious of Trump’s indictments and actions that Biden isn’t any better. In the new poll, 5 percent of Republicans say Trump is too corrupt to be president. Nearly 7 in 10 say Biden is — about the same as the percentage of Democrats who view Trump as “too corrupt.”",3/15/2024,Philip Bump,Washington Post,United States
https://www.foxnews.com/politics/historian-correctly-predicted-every-election-since-1984-reveals-who-likely-win,Historian who correctly predicted almost every election winner since 1984 reveals who is likely to win in 2024,"The ""Keys to the White House"" are being handed out, predicting President Biden currently holds a slight lead in a hypothetical 2024 matchup against former President Donald Trump.

Allan Lichtman, an election prognosticator who has correctly predicted nearly every presidential race since 1984, developed a formula that is used to make predictions about an upcoming presidential election — and in many cases, it proves to be accurate.

Lichtman's ""Keys to the White House"" consists of 13 true or false questions that he believes establish a strong indication of who will be named the victor on the fall ballot. Each question is asked about the two dueling nominees; if ""true"" they are given a ""key,"" and if ""false,"" their competitor receives the point.

Thus far, Biden holds five of the ""keys,"" while Trump was able to capture about three, Lichtman revealed to MarketWatch. That leaves five keys still up for grabs, and enough room for the former president to secure a lead before November.

According to American University, where Lichtman teaches, the ""keys"" are as follows: party mandate, contest, incumbency, third party, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failure, foreign/military success, incumbent charisma and challenger charisma.

Biden's incumbency grants him one automatic point, that of key number three. 

While Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. met the requirements to appear on the Utah presidential election ballot, Biden was granted another ""key"" for not appearing to have any significant third party or independent primary challenge.

The Democrat was also given ""keys"" for having ""real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms,"" as well as implementing policy changes during his presidency.

Trump, however, secured key number one, which is granted to whoever's political party holds the majority in the House of Representatives — which goes to the GOP.

Painting Biden as having a lack of charisma, Lichtman gave Trump the 12th key, and possibly another point if Biden fails to have ""a major success in foreign or military affairs.""

","Donald Trump is ahead of his Republican opponents on key measures of popularity, while US President Joe Biden’s job approval rating has hit a new low, according to a new poll.

The findings from an ABC News/Ipsos poll published on Sunday come a day ahead of the Iowa caucuses as the 2024 race to the US presidential elections speeds up.

The survey showed that former President Trump leads with a huge advantage against the other Republican candidates – Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson – on three fronts.

At least 68 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents say Trump is the candidate with the “best chance” of getting elected in November. That plummets to 12 percent for Haley, 11 percent for DeSantis and single digits for the rest, the report said.

Trump also has an advantage compared to the other candidates in being rated the “strongest leader” and being the “best qualified” to serve as president.

Trump beats his opponents on empathy and shared values as well. He got the most votes – though by a lesser margin – for being the one who “best represents your values” and for best understanding “your problems”.

But Republicans with a four-year college degree were less likely than non-graduates to say Trump was best on each of the attributes tested. Just 27 percent of those with a college degree said Trump best understands the problems of people like them, compared with 57 percent of those without a degree.

Overall, more than 70 percent of Republican adults would be satisfied with Trump as a nominee.

By comparison, 57 percent of Democrats would feel the same about President Biden being the Democratic Party’s choice.

According to the survey, Biden’s job approval rating has dropped to a low for any US president in the past 15 years.

At 33 percent, Biden’s approval rating is worse “than Trump’s low as president (36 percent) and the lowest since George W Bush from 2006-2008”, read the report. Fifty-eight percent disapprove of Biden’s work.

Some 31 percent of women approve of Biden’s work in office, a new low. Back in 2020, he won 57 percent of women. Among men, 34 percent approve of his work in office.

There was also no good news from Black and Hispanic voters: Biden’s approval rating is 21 points below average among Black people and 15 points below average among Hispanic people, compared with 6 points among white people.

When comparing the main Republican and Democratic hopefuls, the report said Biden leads Trump in perceptions of his honesty and trustworthiness – 41 percent say this describes Biden, and 26 percent say it describes Trump. But Trump beats Biden in perceptions of “mental sharpness” and “physical health” needed to be president again.

The survey asked respondents,” Regardless of who you prefer, who do you think would win the presidential election if Joe Biden were the Democratic candidate and Donald Trump were the Republican candidate?”

While the two are tied with 44 percent each in a head-to-head matchup, more believe Trump would actually emerge as the victor. Forty-five percent said they believe Trump would win, compared to 34 percent who expressed the same confidence in Biden. One in five, 21 percent, remain unsure.

Trump maintains his advantage among registered voters, specifically, as 44 percent believe he would win compared to 37 percent who said the same of Biden. Republicans are more confident that Trump would win than Democrats are confident that Biden would win, with 84 percent confidence and 73 percent confidence, respectively.

Independents are the most confident that Trump would come out on top — 45 percent to Biden’s 21 percent, a difference of 24 points. Notably, independents also side with Trump in a head-to-head matchup, giving Trump an 18-point advantage.

The survey, taken February 11-13, 2024, among 1,671 Americans, comes as more questions surface over what many believe is Biden’s deteriorating mental state. Fuel was added to the mounting concerns following a damning report released by Special Counsel Robert Hur, who found that Biden willfully retained classified material but essentially concluded that he is too mentally feeble to prosecute, providing several examples.

“We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” the report reads in part. “Based on our direct interactions with and observations of him, he is someone for whom many jurors will want to identify reasonable doubt.”

It adds, “It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him — by then a former president well into his eighties — of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.”

Further, the report also noted that Biden could not remember when he was vice president, nor when his son Beau died.
Former President Donald Trump responded to these reports during a rally in Conway, South Carolina this month.

“The special counsel’s report tries to let Biden off by claiming that he is too mentally incompetent to convict at a trial,” Trump said.

“I’m not going to charge him with a crime, but it’s okay for him to become Commander in Chief’ – think of that one,” he exclaimed, adding, “But we know that Joe Biden has always been too mentally incompetent.”",2/17/2024,HANNAH BLEAU KNUDSEN,BREITBART,United States

The outcome of contests across Georgia, Mississippi, and Washington State was never in doubt. Neither Biden, a Democrat, nor Trump, a Republican, faced major opposition. But the magnitude of their wins gave each man the delegate majority he needed to claim his party's nomination at the summertime national conventions.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president in US history, while the 77-year-old Trump is facing decades in prison as a defendant in four criminal cases. Their rematch – the first featuring two US presidents since 1912 – will almost certainly deepen the nation's searing political and cultural divides over the eight-month grind that lies ahead.
In a statement, Biden celebrated the nomination while casting Trump as a serious threat to democracy. Trump, Biden said, ""is running a campaign of resentment, revenge, and retribution that threatens the very idea of America."" He continued, ""I am honored that the broad coalition of voters representing the rich diversity of the Democratic Party across the country have put their faith in me once again to lead our party – and our country – in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever.""

On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, Trump acknowledged that Biden would be the Democratic nominee. ""I assume he's going to be the candidate,"" Trump said of Biden on CNBC. ""I'm his only opponent other than life, life itself.""

Both candidates dominated Tuesday's primaries in swing-state Georgia, deep-red Mississippi and Democratic-leaning Washington. Voting was taking place later in Hawaii's Republican caucus.

91 felony counts
Despite their tough talk, the road ahead will not be easy for either presumptive nominee. Trump is facing 91 felony counts in four criminal cases involving his handling of classified documents and his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, among other alleged crimes. He's also facing increasingly pointed questions about his policy plans and relationships with some of the world's most dangerous dictators. Trump met privately on Friday with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has rolled back democracy in his country.

Biden, who would be 86 years old at the end of his next term, is working to assure a skeptical electorate that he's still physically and mentally able to thrive in the world's most important job. Voters in both parties are unhappy with his handling of immigration and inflation.

","WASHINGTON (AP) — The big news this week, President Joe Biden said at a weekend Washington roast, was that two candidates had clinched their party’s nomination for president. But one was too old, too mentally unfit for the job, he said.

“The other’s me,” Biden quipped.

The digs against Republican Donald Trump kept coming from the president at the annual Gridiron Club and Foundation Dinner, as Biden deflected ongoing criticism that his memory is hazy and he appears confused, instead highlighting moments when the 77-year-old Trump has slipped up, too.

“Don’t tell him, he thinks he’s running against Barack Obama, that’s what he said,” said Biden, 81, who also quipped that he was staying up way past his bedtime.

It was the first time Biden has attended the dinner during his presidency, and comes as the 2024 election looms and the rematch between Biden and Trump heats up. The annual bacchanalia, now in its 139th year, traces its history to 1885 — that was the year President Grover Cleveland refused to attend. Every president since has come to at least one Gridiron.

Biden veered quickly into the somber, though, highlighting what he sees as a real threat to democracy should Trump — who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen — return to the White House. The speech had echoes of Biden’s campaign remarks, criticizing Trump as well as too soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“We live in an unprecedented moment in democracy,” he said. “An unprecedented moment for history. Democracy and freedom are literally under attack. Putin’s on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down to him and says to him, ‘do whatever the hell you want.’”

Biden then introduced the Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Markarova, and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.

“We will not bow down. They will not bow down, and I will not bow down,” he said.

Biden, dressed in white-tie attire as is the custom, brought his daughter Ashley.

The dinner has a reputation as a night of bipartisan mirth, and was jam-packed with politicians and who’s-who of Washington, including Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, at least eight other Cabinet members, at least five members of Congress, five governors and at least five ambassadors. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who’s in town for St. Patrick’s Day, also attended.

Also speaking at the dinner were Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican.

Biden closed out the dinner, speaking also about the importance of a free press. Although he may not agree with everything the news media prints, he said, he understands the necessity of journalism and said he was still working to bring home journalists Evan Gershovich and Austin Tice, one held in Russia, the other who disappeared during a reporting trip in Syria.

“Good journalism holds a mirror up to society,” he said. “We need you.”

Biden and Harris were seated at the head table along with other administration officials and the foreign leaders, plus Gridiron president Dan Balz of the Washington Post. Seated also at the table were Balz’s bosses, the Post’s Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and the newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos.

The dinner was held at the Grand Hyatt. No phot os or TV were allowed.
