",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/14/trump-leads-opponents-in-popularity-biden-approval-hits-new-low-us-poll,"Donald Trump is ahead of his Republican opponents on key measures of popularity, while US President Joe Biden’s job approval rating has hit a new low, according to a new poll.

The findings from an ABC News/Ipsos poll published on Sunday come a day ahead of the Iowa caucuses as the 2024 race to the US presidential elections speeds up.

The survey showed that former President Trump leads with a huge advantage against the other Republican candidates – Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, Vivek Ramaswamy and Asa Hutchinson – on three fronts.

At least 68 percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents say Trump is the candidate with the “best chance” of getting elected in November. That plummets to 12 percent for Haley, 11 percent for DeSantis and single digits for the rest, the report said.

Trump also has an advantage compared to the other candidates in being rated the “strongest leader” and being the “best qualified” to serve as president.

Trump beats his opponents on empathy and shared values as well. He got the most votes – though by a lesser margin – for being the one who “best represents your values” and for best understanding “your problems”.

But Republicans with a four-year college degree were less likely than non-graduates to say Trump was best on each of the attributes tested. Just 27 percent of those with a college degree said Trump best understands the problems of people like them, compared with 57 percent of those without a degree.

Joe Biden
Overall, more than 70 percent of Republican adults would be satisfied with Trump as a nominee.

By comparison, 57 percent of Democrats would feel the same about President Biden being the Democratic Party’s choice.

According to the survey, Biden’s job approval rating has dropped to a low for any US president in the past 15 years.

At 33 percent, Biden’s approval rating is worse “than Trump’s low as president (36 percent) and the lowest since George W Bush from 2006-2008”, read the report. Fifty-eight percent disapprove of Biden’s work.

Some 31 percent of women approve of Biden’s work in office, a new low. Back in 2020, he won 57 percent of women. Among men, 34 percent approve of his work in office.

There was also no good news from Black and Hispanic voters: Biden’s approval rating is 21 points below average among Black people and 15 points below average among Hispanic people, compared with 6 points among white people.

When comparing the main Republican and Democratic hopefuls, the report said Biden leads Trump in perceptions of his honesty and trustworthiness – 41 percent say this describes Biden, and 26 percent say it describes Trump. But Trump beats Biden in perceptions of “mental sharpness” and “physical health” needed to be president again.

“A Biden/Trump general election, if that’s the outcome of the primary season, would represent a battle of markedly unpopular candidates,” the report added.",1/14/2024,Carolyn Kaster,AL JAZEERA,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Michigan Supreme Court""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Nikki Haley""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""US""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Maine""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Ron DeSantis""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Asa Hutchinson""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""ABC News/Ipsos""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Vivek Ramaswamy""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Iowa caucuses""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Canada""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""South America""}]",-1.0
"What Biden's record low approval rating, Trump sweeping Iowa caucuses tells us ahead of November 2024 election
",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/what-bidens-record-low-approval-rating-trump-sweeping-iowa-caucuses-tells-us-ahead-november-2024-election,"President Biden's approval rating, the lowest for any U.S. president in the past 15 years, combined with former President Trump's sweeping win in the Iowa caucuses, serves as a bellwether ahead of the November 2024 general election – but political observers question whether it's too soon to assume a Biden-Trump rematch has been secured. 

Yet several politicos who spoke to Fox News Digital predict if a rematch doesn't happen, it will be because of Biden getting out of the race – not Trump failing to secure the nomination.

""A unique aspect of this presidential year is that there really is no primary season for either party. Biden has managed to keep challengers off the ballots and Trump's lead amongst GOP voters is astronomical. Trump's landslide in Iowa is a statement. And while the debates and this process is important for people to get to know the GOP talent bench, the fact is we are in the midst of the general election between Biden and Trump,"" Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce said. 

""Trump is going nowhere, but Biden still could be replaced, but the closer we get to Election Day the more unlikely it is to happen,"" she added. 

BIDEN APPROVAL RATING PLUMMETS TO 15-YEAR LOW, POLL FINDS



Trump won all but one of Iowa's 99 counties, with former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley – who came in third place overall in the Hawkeye State – clinging onto Johnson County by one vote. After congratulating Haley and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis – the second-place winner in Iowa – during his Iowa victory speech for ""having a good time together,"" the leader of the ""Make America Great Again"" movement was back in New York on Tuesday. 

""Donald Trump’s crushing victory over his opponents in the Iowa caucuses isn’t quite enough to wrap up the Republican nomination before the first primary contest has even taken place. But it very nearly is,"" Fox News contributor Gerry Baker said. ""The results confirmed the grip the former president has on GOP primary voters."" 

Baker, who is in Davos to attend the World Economic Forum, further surmised of the Iowa caucuses that ""the third-place finish for Nikki Haley, who seemed to have some momentum heading into Iowa but who now must score a victory in New Hampshire next week to keep the race alive at all, underscored how far behind she and Ron DeSantis have always been."" 

""So Trump is set to wrap things up quickly and will then be free of GOP opposition to concentrate his fire on Joe Biden,"" Baker said. 

""This only adds to the escalating bad news for Biden, already struggling with some of the lowest approval ratings for any president in recent history. With an uncertain economic outlook, chaos at the border and rising insecurity in the world, Biden faces overwhelming headwinds,"" he said. ""Don’t be surprised if the calls within his own party for him to stand down and for a Democratic nominating contest to take place at this summer’s convention grow much louder."" 

Biden’s approval rating sits at just 33%, according to a new ABC News/Ipsos poll released Sunday, a day before the Iowa caucuses, meaning the incumbent Democrat has the lowest approval rating of any U.S. president since George W. Bush from 2006-2008. Trump’s lowest as president was 36%. 

""If you're a Democrat, this is near a worst case scenario in a presidential election year. Here you have an incumbent president that's polling in the 20s as far as approval among Independents. He is hemorrhaging support from Black and Hispanic voters. No president has won re-election with approval below 40%, Biden is currently at 33% overall,"" Fox News contributor Joe Concha assessed. ""Meanwhile, Donald Trump just won Iowa by more than four touchdowns over a popular governor and formidable challenger in the form of Ron DeSantis. According to the RealClearPolitics betting averages, he is the odds on favorite to win back the presidency."" 

""And unless prices begin to go down, which they likely won't, and the border somehow improves, which it won't, and these wars overseas suddenly end, which they won't, it's hard to see how Biden turns us around as he continues to get older and less visible to American voters,"" Concha added. 

Regarding the survey, Bruce argued that Biden's ""remarkably low poll ratings are even more shocking because he has had the general support of the legacy media."" 

""The Democrats don't seem to realize that their success in 2020 using the basement strategy has given them the entirely wrong impression about the American people,"" she said. ""They believe they can do it again, but what they had in 2020 that they don't have now is the trust of the American people.""

TRUMP TEASES EX-RIVAL DOUG BURGUM COULD HOLD 'IMPORTANT' ADMIN ROLE AFTER IOWA WIN

The poll found that just 31% of Americans approve of how Biden is handling the economy, while 56% disapprove. And Biden's rating on immigration and the border crisis is especially low, according to the ABC-produced poll, which found just 18% approve of the job he's done, while 63% now disapprove.

Biden is polling at 28% approval among Independents, while the survey found he's 21 points below average among African Americans and 15 points below average among Hispanics.

""Biden’s numbers are nothing short of disastrous at this stage,"" Fox News contributor Guy Benson said. ""With an approval rating of 33%, and underwater by 25 points on the economy, he’s going to have to run an extremely negative campaign to try to compensate for this historic weakness. There’s a reason why Brit Hume recently said on my radio program that Biden is the weakest presidential incumbent he’s seen in his decades of political coverage.""

"Lindsey Graham ‘threw Trump under the bus’ in Georgia case, book says
",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/jan/24/find-me-the-votes-book-graham-trump-georgia,"The South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham “threw Donald Trump under the bus” in testimony to a grand jury investigating election subversion in Georgia, a new book reportedly says, revealing that the former president would have believed “martians came and stole the election” he lost to Joe Biden in 2020.

“After fighting a four-month legal battle all the way to the US supreme court to block his grand jury subpoena – and losing … Graham turned on a dime ‘and threw Trump under the bus’,” Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman write in Find Me the Votes: A Hard-Charging Georgia Prosecutor, a Rogue President, and the Plot to Steal an American Election, Politico reported.
“According to secret grand jury testimony in Fulton county confirmed by the authors, Graham testified that if you told Trump ‘that martians came and stole the election, he’d probably believe you’. He also suggested to the grand jurors that Trump cheated at golf.”

The book, which cites “a source familiar with [Graham’s] testimony”, will be published next week.

Trump’s cheating at golf has been widely reported.

Isikoff and Klaidman also reportedly describe a “strange encounter” between Graham and Fani Willis, the Fulton county district attorney who has pursued the election subversion case, producing 13 criminal charges against Trump and charging a host of his allies.

Willis reportedly decided against charging Graham over his involvement in Trump’s attempt to overturn Biden’s win in the state.

“After Graham was finished testifying,” Isikoff and Klaidman write, “he bumped into Fani Willis in a hallway and thanked her for the opportunity to tell his story.

“‘That was so cathartic,’ he told Willis. ‘I feel so much better.’ Then, to the astonishment of one source who witnessed the scene, South Carolina’s senior senator hugged the Fulton county DA who was aggressively pursuing Trump.

“Willis’s reaction: ‘She was like, “Whatever, dude,”’ according to one witness of the strange encounter.”

Trump’s criminal charges in Georgia contribute to a total of 91, as do four federal charges concerning his attempt to overturn his 2020 defeat by Biden.
The former president also faces 40 charges over the retention of classified information; 34 regarding hush-money payments to an adult film actor who claimed an affair; civil lawsuits over his business affairs and a defamation claim arising from a rape allegation a judge said was “substantially true”; and attempts to remove him from the ballot, for inciting the January 6 insurrection.

Nonetheless, he has dominated the Republican presidential primary, winning convincingly in Iowa and New Hampshire and now pressuring his last rival, the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, to drop out.

Graham remains, in public, a vocal Trump supporter, oblivious to charges of hypocrisy given a famous 2016 prediction that Trump would “destroy” the Republican party, and given a claim, immediately after the attack on Congress, that he was finally “out” of Trump’s camp.",1/24/2024,Martin Pengelly ,The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""election""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""American Election""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Fulton county""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Fani Willis""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""golf""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""South Carolina""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Daniel Klaidman""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Politico""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""US supreme court""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Lindsey Graham""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""grand jury""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Michael Isikoff""}]",0.42
Decoding Democrat Joe Biden’s 2024 Abortion Playbook,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/02/02/decoding-democrat-joe-biden-2024-abortion-playbook/,"Killing the unborn is President Joe Biden’s day-one, number-one priority if he is reelected, his staff has said — a strategy likely designed to bludgeon Republicans and appeal to a wide swath of women and young voters accustomed to 50 years of the “right” to abortion invented under the now-defunct Roe v. Wade decision.

The strategy is interesting, given that most overall polling shows the issue of abortion is not Americans’ top priority. But the intense focus is not unexpected, given that one in four Democrats are single-issue voters on abortion and that the majority of independents identify as “pro-choice.” The focus on abortion and painting Republicans as dangerous to women also seems like a ploy to distract from Americans’ top concerns under the Biden administration: the flailing economy and the border, which is essentially open.

In contrast, many Republicans have been eager to shelve the abortion issue going into election season, instead focusing on Biden’s apparent declining mental health, the scandal with his son Hunter, and other various failures. But the GOP should know that in their silence, abortion groups are bankrolling Democrats and corporate media are filling the internet and airwaves with pro-abortion talking points in an effort to keep tight control of the “reproductive rights” narrative going into the election.

Here are five ways self-professed Catholic Joe Biden, 81, is using the issue of abortion as a top strategy ahead of the November presidential election.

“Restore Roe”
Biden, flanked by Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses, made his first campaign stop in Virginia last week, harping on the issue of abortion in front of a large banner that read, “Restore Roe.”

In June of 2022, the Supreme Court issued its Dobbs decision, which overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision inventing a constitutional “right” to abortion and sent the issue back to individual states. Under Roe, a “right” to abortion was established before “viability,” which is generally considered to be between 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. Since Dobbs, some states have passed stricter laws regulating abortion, while others, run by Democrats, have loosened abortion laws and appealed to pro-abortion women in red states.

Following the Dobbs decision, the Biden White House and Democrats have called for the restoration of Roe, which would federalize the issue of abortion again. Democrats have repeatedly tried to pass the radical Women’s Health Protection Act, which they claim would restore Roe. But opponents of the legislation, including Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV), say the bill is an “expansion” of Roe and could lead to abortion throughout pregnancy across the country. Biden has pledged to sign the bill should it ever reach his desk.

In the meantime, the Biden administration has arguably become the most pro-abortion administration in U.S. history, working through executive orders, rule-making and guidance from unelected government bureaucrats, and various legal challenges to install its abortion-on-demand agenda around the country and the world.



Part of Biden’s focus on restoring Roe includes blaming former President Donald Trump — the likely Republican nominee — for installing three Supreme Court justices who ultimately helped overturn Roe. Trump has touted his nominations and the overturn of Roe as one of his major first-term victories.

“Let there be no mistake. The person most responsible for taking away this freedom in America is Donald Trump,” Biden said during his first campaign speech.

“The reason women are being forced to travel across state lines for health care is Donald Trump,” he added. “The reason their fundamental right has been stripped away is Donald Trump.”

“Donald Trump is betting we won’t vote on this issue … He’s betting you’re going to stop caring … that you’ll get distracted, discouraged and stay home,” he said. “Well guess what? I’m betting he’s wrong.”

Threaten a National Abortion Ban
While promising federal action of their own, Democrats and Biden have warned that Republicans would pass a national abortion ban, should a Republican reside at the White House again.


After years of working toward bringing the issue of abortion back to states, some pro-life groups and lawmakers have floated the idea of a national 15-week limit after Dobbs — a limit that would notably allow the majority of abortions to continue but would bar later-term abortions. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) even introduced a bill right before the 2022 midterms.


Some Republican presidential candidates (now ex-candidates) pledged to sign a federal minimum restriction. Trump has not committed to a specific action on abortion if he is reelected. However, he has said the federal government has a “vital role” to play in protecting the unborn and has framed Democrats’ late-term abortion position as “extreme.”

“I want to do what’s right. And we’re looking. And we want to do what’s right for everybody,” he said during a May 2023 CNN town hall. “But now, for the first time, the people that are pro-life have negotiating capability, because you didn’t have it before. They could kill the baby in the ninth month or after the baby was born. Now they won’t be able to do that.”

Steal Conservative Talking Points
The “right to choose” is not a new line from Democrats. But the slogan has been repackaged around the country as “reproductive freedom,” while Democrats cast laws that protect the unborn as “government interference” in personal decisions.


While the Biden administration has no problem coercing Americans to get a vaccine they do not want, surveilling bank accounts, or framing everyday Americans as potential domestic terrorism suspects, the idea of “freedom” and preventing “government interference” is liberally applied to their own political agenda regarding LGBTQIA2S and abortion issues.




Linking abortion — the intentional killing of the unborn — to “freedom” and “government interference,” is a strategy Democrats and pro-abortion activists have also pushed in state abortion amendment fights around the country since the 2022 midterms.

Left-wing coalitions have paid millions of dollars advertising abortion ballot measures in this framing, along with visuals of family, faith, and American flags waving. The organizations behind these measures also typically outspend pro-life groups by double and triple, often backed by dark money groups.

The strategy has been successful so far, with a string of state-level pro-abortion victories following the fall of Roe v. Wade. Activists in at least nine other states are working to put abortion amendments on the ballot this year, adding more abortion-related fuel to what is expected to be a highly contentious election.

Furthermore, Democrats push the “freedom” narrative while avoiding dialogue around fetal development, points in gestation, or the more gruesome aspects of abortion, which can include the crushing and dismemberment of a baby in the womb.

Create Confusion
Another strategy is lumping elective abortions in with other things like birth control and miscarriages (also medically referred to as spontaneous abortion) under the umbrella term “reproductive health.”

It is a strategy that Democrats have employed since the fall of Roe, some falsely claiming that women will be unable to obtain miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy care or even birth control if abortion is limited.



On the state level, many abortion ballot measures are framed in this way, giving all people (not just females) the right to make their own “reproductive decisions,” “including but not limited to abortion.” Lumping all reproductive-related issues together gives abortion-related campaigning extra weight, especially among women who believe the narrative and are fearful of being denied necessary care and dying of sepsis.

Point to High-Profile Cases of Women Denied Abortions
Since some Republican-led states have passed abortion restrictions, ongoing high-profile cases have emerged of women being denied abortions in alleged life-threatening situations.

Biden has begun to campaign with some of the women involved in these cases, holding them up as an example of how dangerous Republicans’ abortion laws allegedly are.

Specifically, Biden and first lady Jill Biden invited Kate Cox, who left Texas in December to have her disabled baby aborted, to the annual State of the Union address in March.


In Texas, abortion is outlawed except to save the life of the pregnant woman or prevent serious risk to her physical health, and a doctor can be prosecuted for performing the procedure.

Cox, a 31-year-old mother of two, sued the state of Texas with The Center for Reproductive Rights to obtain an abortion after she learned that her unborn baby had Trisomy 18, otherwise known as Edwards syndrome.

Trisomy 18 is a very severe genetic condition that can cause multiple birth defects — 95 percent of babies with the condition do not survive full-term, and ten percent of babies born with the condition typically do not survive past their first year, according to the Cleveland Clinic. There are rare cases of people born with Trisomy 18 living much longer, such as the daughter of former Republican U.S. senator and pro-life advocate Rick Santorum, Isabella, who is now 15 years old. A 2020 scientific journal also describes a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with the condition who has “severe growth and intellectual limitations” but has lived much longer than expected.

The lawsuit alleged that Cox had been to three different emergency rooms within a month due to “severe cramping and unidentifiable fluid leaks.” The lawsuit also alleged that her history of having two prior cesarean surgeries meant that continuing the pregnancy “put[s] her at high risk for severe complications threatening her life and future fertility, including uterine rupture and hysterectomy.”

The complaint argued that it is Dr. Damla Karsan’s (Cox’s healthcare provider) “good faith belief and medical recommendation” that Cox’s circumstances “fall within the medical exception to Texas’s abortion bans and laws.” The lawsuit ultimately asked the court to block the state from enforcing its abortion laws to allow Karsan to abort Cox’s unborn baby.

Ultimately, the Texas Supreme Court halted a lower court ruling in December of 2023 allowing Cox, who was 20 weeks pregnant at the time, to have her unborn baby aborted. The state’s high court blocked a temporary restraining order from Democrat Travis County District Judge Maya Guerra Gamble after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton asked the court to intervene.

As to the Texas Supreme Court’s reasoning, justices wrote in part that Dr. Karsan never actually asserted that Cox had a “life-threatening physical condition” or that “in Dr. Karsan’s reasonable medical judgment, an abortion is necessary because Ms. Cox has the type of condition the exception requires.”

“No one disputes that Ms. Cox’s pregnancy has been extremely complicated. Any parents would be devastated to learn of their unborn child’s trisomy 18 diagnosis,” the justices wrote.

“Some difficulties in pregnancy, however, even serious ones, do not pose the heightened risks to the mother the exception encompasses,” they continued. “The exception requires a doctor to decide whether Ms. Cox’s difficulties pose such risks. Dr. Karsan asked a court to pre-authorize the abortion yet she could not, or at least did not, attest to the court that Ms. Cox’s condition poses the risks the exception requires.”

Cox ended up leaving Texas to have her baby aborted at around 21 weeks of pregnancy. Abortions at that stage of pregnancy typically are done with a dilation and evacuation (D & E) procedure, which can involve “crushing, dismemberment and removal of a fetal body from a woman’s uterus, mere weeks before, or even after, the fetus reaches a developmental age of potential viability outside the mother,” according to the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute.

Before inviting Cox to the State of the Union, Biden was introduced by Amanda Zurawski at his first abortion-themed campaign rally in Virginia. Zurawski was one of five women who sued Texas last year for not being able to obtain an abortion while facing pregnancy complications.

The Biden-Harris reelection campaign also recently released an advertisement featuring Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Texas and mother of three who was denied an abortion in Texas.

"Biden sweeps South Carolina Democratic primary with ‘loser’ taunt at Trump
",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/4/biden-sweeps-south-carolina-democratic-primary-with-loser-taunt-at-trump,"United States President Joe Biden has comfortably won South Carolina’s Democratic primary, promising afterwards that he would make Republican rival Donald Trump a loser for a second time in November’s election.

Biden on Saturday defeated the other long-shot Democrats on South Carolina’s ballot, including Minnesota Congressman Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson, notching an overwhelming victory in the state that vaulted him to the White House in 2020.

Democrats will now pore over the results to see how well the 81-year-old incumbent, battling low approval ratings, mobilised the Black voters who helped propel him to the White House against Trump, 77, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination to challenge Biden in the election.

‘Donald Trump a loser’
As the results came in, Biden was at a campaign event in California, as he turned his attention to the next steps in his fight for re-election.

“Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the presidency again – and making Donald Trump a loser – again,” Biden said in a statement.

He urged people to get out and vote in November, saying the stakes “could not be higher” if Trump manages a sensational comeback to the Oval Office.
“There are extreme and dangerous voices at work in the country – led by Donald Trump,” he said.

Four years ago, it was South Carolina’s Black vote in the state’s primary that helped ignite Biden’s campaign and ultimately propel him to the White House.

Besides campaign fears that South Carolina’s heavily Black electorate might not be energised this time around, there were also doubts about his age and concerns about high consumer prices and security along the US-Mexican border.

South Carolina has not backed a Democrat for president in the general election since 1976. But because Black people make up the state’s more than half of the Democratic electorate, it presented an important test of Biden’s appeal with a voting base that typically supports Democrats nine-to-one in presidential races.

‘Least popular president’
Carrie Sheffield, senior policy analyst at the advocacy group Independent Women’s Voice, said Biden’s victory in South Carolina does not guarantee him a lead in the presidential race.

“The reality is that this is just a primary and he is the incumbent president, so nobody ever thought he was actually going to lose. But the reality is that President Biden is the least popular president since World War II – that is truly shocking,” she told Al Jazeera.

“His approval ratings are only 33 percent. He is also losing in key battleground states that he won in 2020 against Donald Trump so he is losing overall across the seven battleground states by six points to Trump, and in North Carolina, it’s in double digits. No matter who wins the GOP primary, whether Donald Trump or Nikki Haley, both are beating Biden in the 2024 general election.”

Some South Carolina voters were also lukewarm about Biden’s re-election bid.

“Sometimes I wonder, is his presence enough because you don’t see him a lot, you don’t hear him a lot,” Martin Orr, a school administrator from McConnells, South Carolina, told The Associated Press news agency.

“Is it quiet because of his age or his physical condition, or what’s going on? I think that’s what a lot of people are concerned about right now,” Orr added.

Another issue that is dominating Biden’s re-election campaign is the domestic concerns over the war in Gaza.

For nearly four months now, Israel has been waging a “genocidal” campaign in Gaza, killing more than 27,200 people, displacing almost its entire population and triggering a widespread hunger and health crisis in the besieged enclave.

Israel’s latest campaign against Gaza started after Hamas fighters on October 7 stormed communities in southern Israel, killing more than 1,100 people, mostly civilians, and taking about 240 captives, nearly half of whom have since been released.

Michael Fauntroy, head of the Ronald Walters Leadership and Public Policy Center at Howard University, said Biden is walking “a fine line” as he tries to win Jewish votes while also trying to mediate for an end to the fighting inside Gaza.

“He seems to have been working very hard to get the Israelis to slow down and he has not publicly called for a ceasefire, but I think he understands that that is where the US policy will have to go,” Fauntroy told Al Jazeera.",2/4/2024, AP,AL JAZEERA,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Democratic primary""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""United States""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Dean Phillips""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""White House""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Gaza""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Michigan""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Minnesota""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Marianne Williamson""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""US""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Oval Office""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""California""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democratic""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""South Carolina""}]",0.52
20-point deficit on handling economy highlights Biden’s struggles against Trump,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-biden-trump-economy-presidential-race-rcna136834,"Despite a growing economy and little opposition for his party’s nomination, President Joe Biden confronts a dissatisfied electorate and a challenging political climate nine months before he faces re-election, according to a new national NBC News poll.

Biden trails GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump on major policy and personal comparisons, including by more than 20 points on which candidate would better handle the economy. And Biden’s deficit versus Trump on handling immigration and the border is greater than 30 points.

The poll also shows Trump holding a 16-point advantage over Biden on being competent and effective, a reversal from 2020, when Biden was ahead of Trump on this quality by 9 points before defeating him in that election.

And Biden’s approval rating has declined to the lowest level of his presidency in NBC News polling — to 37% — while fewer than 3 in 10 voters approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war.

All together, these numbers explain why the poll shows Trump leading Biden by 5 points among registered voters in a hypothetical 2024 general-election matchup, 47% to 42%. While the result is within the poll’s margin of error, the last year of polling shows a clear shift.


Perhaps the best news in the poll for Biden is that he pulls ahead of Trump when voters are asked about their ballot choice if the former president is convicted of a felony. Yet the margin then is just 2 points in Biden’s favor, also within the margin of error.

Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates, who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff and his team at Public Opinion Strategies, says these findings reveal “a presidency in peril.”

“What is most concerning is the erosion of Biden’s standing against Trump compared to four years ago,” Horwitt said. “On every measure compared to 2020, Biden has declined. Most damning, the belief that Biden is more likely to be up to the job — the chief tenet of the Biden candidacy — has evaporated.”

McInturff, the GOP pollster, adds: “It is hard to imagine a more difficult set of numbers before a re-election.”

But Horwitt said that Biden still has time to change voters’ perceptions.

“Biden can take solace that we are in January and not October 2024. At this stage in prior cycles, attitudes can change,” he said.


The NBC News poll, conducted Jan. 26-30, comes after Trump won his party’s presidential nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, as the Israel-Hamas war enters its fourth month, and amid positive news on the U.S. economy, including growing consumer confidence and more than 300,000 jobs created last month.

(The poll, however, was conducted before the U.S. military launched strikes Friday in retaliation for the killings of three U.S. service members in Jordan.)

“Inflation is coming down. Jobs are growing. We created 800,000 manufacturing jobs,” Biden boasted in Michigan on Thursday.

Despite those statistics, Trump holds a 22-point advantage over Biden on the question of which candidate would do a better job handling the economy, with 55% picking Trump and 33% choosing Biden.


When this question was last asked in October 2020 — a month before Biden’s victory over Trump — the then-president held only a 7-point advantage over Biden, 48% to 41%.

That said, the poll shows improving attitudes about the economy, with the share of voters believing the economy will get worse in the next year declining 14 points since October 2022.

Also in the poll, Trump has the edge on securing the border and controlling immigration (35 points over Biden), on having the necessary mental and physical health to be president (+23), on dealing with crime and violence (+21), on being competent and effective (+16), and on improving America’s standing in the world (+11).

Biden holds advantages over Trump on dealing with abortion (+12) and protecting immigrant rights (+17).

The two men are essentially tied on the issue of protecting democracy, with 43% of voters preferring Biden and 41% picking Trump.

Biden’s approval rating falls to new low
The NBC News poll also finds Biden’s overall approval rating dropping to the lowest point of his presidency, with 37% of registered voters approving and 60% disapproving — down from November’s score of 40% approving, 57% disapproving.

Biden’s current approval rating is the lowest for any president in the NBC News poll since George W. Bush’s second term.


In the new poll, Biden’s approval rating has declined especially among Latinos (just 35% of them now approve of his job performance), voters ages 18-34 (29%) and independents (27%).

Additionally, 36% of voters in the poll approve of Biden’s handling of the economy (down 2 points from November), 34% approve of his handling of foreign policy (down 1 point) and 29% approve of his handling of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza (down 5 points).

Among voters under 35 years old, only 15% approve of Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war, while a whopping 70% disapprove.

“A major through line in what ails Biden most are his travails with younger voters,” said Horwitt, the Democratic pollster.

Measuring a Biden-Trump rematch
In a hypothetical head-to-head matchup in November’s presidential contest, Trump gets support from 47% of registered voters, versus 42% who back Biden.

Biden aims to win Wisconsin and Michigan by leaning heavily on more popular women
That 5-point lead for Trump — within the poll’s margin of error — is up from November’s 2-point advantage for Trump, 46% to 44%.

It’s consistent with other recent polling, including CNN’s national survey and battleground-state polls from Bloomberg News and Morning Consult. But a recent national Quinnipiac University poll found Biden with a 6-point lead over Trump, 50% to 44%. Overall, national surveys point to a divided country in a testy mood — and a highly contested election on the horizon.

In the new NBC News poll, Biden holds the advantage over Trump among Black voters (75% to 16%), women (50% to 40%) and white people with college degrees (50% to 42%).

Trump, meanwhile, has leads among white people without college degrees (62% to 29%), men (56% to 34%) and independents (48% to 29%).

The two men are essentially tied among Latinos (Trump 42%, Biden 41%) and voters ages 18-34 (at 42% each). Among the youngest slice of voters measured, those ages 18-29, Biden has a narrow advantage (Biden 46%, Trump 38%).

But when the poll re-asks voters — on the survey’s final question — about their ballot choice if Trump is found guilty and convicted of a felony this year, the picture shifts. Biden jumps ahead of Trump among registered voters in that case, 45% to 43%. (Read more here.)

Testing Biden, Trump and third parties
In a hypothetical matchup featuring third parties, Trump’s advantage over Biden grows to 6 points, 41% to 35% — with an unnamed Libertarian Party candidate getting 5% support, an unnamed Green Party candidate getting another 5% and an unnamed No Labels candidate getting 4%.

(While the poll didn’t test a ballot including independent presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Cornel West, who are still seeking state ballot access across the country, it finds 34% of all registered voters saying they could see themselves supporting Kennedy and 10% saying the same of West.)

And in a hypothetical matchup featuring Biden and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, the NBC News poll shows Haley leading Biden by 9 points, 45% to 36%.

Trump leads Haley by 60 points in GOP race
As for Haley and the GOP presidential race after Iowa and New Hampshire, the poll has Trump leading his former U.N. ambassador by a whopping 60 points among national GOP primary voters, 79% to 19%.


In a separate question, 61% of these Republican voters say Trump should continue as the party’s leader; 14% say Trump was a good president, but it’s time to consider other leaders; and 22% say the GOP needs a new leader with better personal behavior and a different approach.",2/4/2024,Mark Murray,NBC News,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Hart Research Associates""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Bill McInturff""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Jeff Horwitt""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""NBC News""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""border""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Public Opinion Strategies""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Israel-Hamas war""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""GOP""}]",0.56
Historian who correctly predicted almost every election winner since 1984 reveals who is likely to win in 2024,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/historian-correctly-predicted-every-election-since-1984-reveals-who-likely-win,"The ""Keys to the White House"" are being handed out, predicting President Biden currently holds a slight lead in a hypothetical 2024 matchup against former President Donald Trump.

Allan Lichtman, an election prognosticator who has correctly predicted nearly every presidential race since 1984, developed a formula that is used to make predictions about an upcoming presidential election — and in many cases, it proves to be accurate.

Lichtman's ""Keys to the White House"" consists of 13 true or false questions that he believes establish a strong indication of who will be named the victor on the fall ballot. Each question is asked about the two dueling nominees; if ""true"" they are given a ""key,"" and if ""false,"" their competitor receives the point.

Thus far, Biden holds five of the ""keys,"" while Trump was able to capture about three, Lichtman revealed to MarketWatch. That leaves five keys still up for grabs, and enough room for the former president to secure a lead before November.

According to American University, where Lichtman teaches, the ""keys"" are as follows: party mandate, contest, incumbency, third party, short-term economy, long-term economy, policy change, social unrest, scandal, foreign/military failure, foreign/military success, incumbent charisma and challenger charisma.

BIDEN RESPONDS AFTER TRUMP CALLS FOR AN ‘IMMEDIATE’ PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Biden's incumbency grants him one automatic point, that of key number three. 

While Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. met the requirements to appear on the Utah presidential election ballot, Biden was granted another ""key"" for not appearing to have any significant third party or independent primary challenge.

The Democrat was also given ""keys"" for having ""real per capita economic growth during the term equals or exceeds mean growth during the previous two terms,"" as well as implementing policy changes during his presidency.

Trump, however, secured key number one, which is granted to whoever's political party holds the majority in the House of Representatives — which goes to the GOP.

Painting Biden as having a lack of charisma, Lichtman gave Trump the 12th key, and possibly another point if Biden fails to have ""a major success in foreign or military affairs.""

"Trump says he wants to debate Biden
",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/donald-trump-says-wants-debate-joe-biden-rcna137340,"Former President Donald Trump said Monday that he wants to debate President Joe Biden ahead of November's general election.

In a radio interview on ""The Dan Bongino Show,"" Trump suggested that he would like to ""immediately"" debate his White House successor.

""I’d like to debate him now because we should debate. We should debate for the good of the country,"" Trump said.

Biden responded to Trump's comments on Monday during a stop in Nevada.

“Immediately? Well, if I were him, I’d want to debate me, too. He’s got nothing else to do,” Biden told reporters when asked whether he would agree to Trump's challenge to debate him.


NBC News Poll: Biden trails Trump by 20 points on the economy as his approval ratings plummet
05:09
Trump, who has not participated in any of the GOP primary debates this election cycle, said in a December interview with the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt that he was up for debating Biden, that he would ""look forward"" to doing so.

""How about 10 debates?"" Trump told Hewitt, several weeks before the GOP primary cycle began with the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. The former president won both.

Hewitt noted that the Republican National Committee decided in 2022 to withdraw from presidential debates set up by the Commission on Presidential Debates, which consists of members from both parties and considers itself nonpartisan. The RNC said it would require Republican presidential candidates to instead pledge to only participate in debates sanctioned by the Republican Party.

Trump said that the commission was ""corrupt,"" claiming someone turned off his microphone during a general election debate in 2016. The organization decided during the 2020 presidential campaign that it would cut off Trump's microphone while Biden was answering a question, and vice versa.

""They’re totally corrupt. They’re totally Democrat-leaning, that’s being nice when I use the word leaning,"" Trump said in December. ""They are totally corrupt, and they’re terrible. With that being said, I would do 20 debates even if it was organized by them. I’ll do as many debates as they want. I’d do a debate every night with this guy. But he’ll never show up to a debate.""
The Commission on Presidential Debates announced last year the dates and locations for three 2024 general election debates: Sept. 16 at Texas State University in San Marcos, Oct. 1 at Virginia State University in Petersburg, and Oct. 9 at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

The Biden campaign at the time declined to comment on the proposed schedule.

In 2020, Trump and Biden participated in only two general election debates, instead of the typical three. One debate was canceled after Trump contracted Covid.

This time around, Trump has repeatedly been criticized by his only remaining major GOP opponent, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, for not participating in debates during the primary season.

Haley's campaign seized on Trump's debate comments Monday, saying it is ""thrilled"" that he has ""finally acknowledged the importance of debates.""

""Now it’s time for Trump to man up and agree to debate Nikki Haley,"" Haley spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said in a statement.

"Trump Leads Biden in Michigan, North Carolina in Two-Way Race and in Deeper Field",https://www.breitbart.com/2024-election/2024/02/15/poll-trump-leads-biden-michigan-north-carolina-two-way-race-deeper-field/,"Former President Donald Trump leads President Joe Biden in Michigan and North Carolina in hypothetical head-to-head matchups and in a deeper field, according to a pair of Fox News polls published Thursday.

The Michigan poll, conducted under the direction of Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research, found that 47 percent of registered voters back Trump in a hypothetical head-to-head race with Biden, who garners 45 percent of the response. The two-point lead for Trump falls within the poll’s plus or minus three percent margin of error.


This marks an 11-point swing toward Trump compared to a July 2020 Fox News Beacon Research and Shaw Company poll that had Biden ahead of him at 49 percent to 40 percent.

One percent of respondents would back someone else, three percent would not vote, and four percent are undecided in the latest poll.

When the field is expanded to include independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Green Party candidate Jill Stein, and independent Cornel West, Trump’s lead over Biden and the rest of the pack expands to five points.

Of the respondents, 42 percent would back Trump, and 37 percent would support Biden. Kennedy Jr. comes in third with 11 percent of the vote, followed by Stein at three percent and West at two percent.

In a hypothetical two-way race between Biden and former Gov. Nikki Haley (R-SC) – Trump’s last opponent of relevance in the race for the Republican nomination – Haley leads 43 percent to 42 percent. Three percent would back someone else, five percent would not vote, and seven percent are unsure of who they would back in that scenario.

However, Biden takes a nearly double-digit lead when he and Haley are pitted against a larger field, and she almost falls to third place behind Kennedy Jr. Biden takes 35 percent of the vote, to Haley’s 26 percent and Kennedy Jr.’s 23 percent. West and Stein tie at three percent, with three percent abstaining from voting and seven percent undecided.

The poll sampled 1,106 registered voters from February 8-12.

Trump has an even stronger advantage over Biden in North Carolina, where he garners 50 percent support in a race with just Biden, who takes 45 percent support. Just one percent would vote for someone else, two percent would sit the election out, and three percent are undecided. The five-point lead it outside the plus or minus three percent margin of error.

In the larger field, Trump’s support drops slightly, but his lead over Biden expands by four points. Of the respondents, 46 percent would vote for the 45th president, versus 37 percent who would support Biden. Kennedy Jr. failed to crack double-digits with eight percent, followed by Stein with two percent and West at one percent. Four percent of respondents are undecided.

Haley also leads Biden by five points in their two-way race, but she trails him with more opponents in the fray. Biden takes 33 percent to Haley’s 31 percent, while Kennedy surges to 19 percent. West and Stein each garner two percent in this scenario.

This North Carolina poll, also conducted under the direction of Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research, was taken February 8-11 among 1,099 respondents.

"Trump privately backs 16-week abortion ban with exceptions, report says
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/16/trump-16-week-abortion-ban-exceptions-report,"Donald Trump likes the idea of a national ban on abortion past 16 weeks of pregnancy with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the mother, the New York Times reported on Friday morning.

Trump has veered away from taking a firm stance on abortion during his presidential campaign. He has taken credit for the US supreme court’s 2022 overturning of Roe v Wade, since he appointed three of the justices who took part in that decision, but he has also suggested that Republicans who take extreme stances on abortion lose elections.

“Know what I like about 16?” Trump told one individual, according to the Times, which based its report on two people with knowledge of Trump’s thoughts. “It’s even. It’s four months.”

Trump is waiting until after the conclusion of the Republican primary to publicly discuss his position, the Times reported.

Since Roe’s demise, voters have repeatedly rejected attempts to curtail abortion rights and supported state-level ballot measures to protect the right to the procedure. Outrage over Roe is also widely credited with defeating the promised “red wave” in the 2022 midterms and leaving Republicans with fewer victories than anticipated.

Last year, Virginia Republicans campaigned in a state election on a pledge to ban abortion past 15 weeks, as a kind of “compromise” position. Their efforts to retake control of the state legislature failed.

However, the anti-abortion movement, with its coterie of high-powered activists, has made it clear that they would like to see the procedure totally outlawed. Although most Americans consider themselves “pro-choice”, polling shows they are far less supportive of abortions past the first trimester.

After publication of the Times article, the Trump campaign sent out a statement dismissing it as “fake news”.

“As President Trump has stated, he would sit down with both sides and negotiate a deal that everyone will be happy with,” said Karoline Leavitt, the campaign’s national press secretary. Leavitt then celebrated Trump’s role in overturning Roe and falsely accused Democrats, among other things, of supporting abortion “after birth”, which is infanticide and already illegal in the United States.

The vast majority of abortions take place in the first trimester of pregnancy. However, someone may have an abortion later on in pregnancy due to a medical emergency.

More than a dozen states have enacted near-total abortion bans, several of which do not have exceptions for rape or incest. And doctors have repeatedly said that carve-outs for abortions in cases of medical emergencies have proven so vague as to be unworkable; dozens of women have now come forward to say that they were denied medically necessary abortions.

“Now, after being the one responsible for taking away women’s freedom, after being the one to put women’s lives in danger, after being the one who has unleashed all this cruelty and chaos all across America, Trump is running scared,” Joe Biden said in a statement on Friday afternoon. “He’s afraid that the women of America are going to hold him responsible for taking away their rights and endangering their rights at the ballot box in November. That’s exactly what’s going to happen.”",2/16/2024,Carter Sherman,The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""state-level ballot measures""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""state election""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Trump campaign""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""President Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""presidential campaign""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""elections""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""US supreme court""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Times""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""anti-abortion movement""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Republican primary""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""New York Times""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2022 midterms""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Virginia""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}]",0.49
More Believe Trump Would Win 2024 Election than Would Pick Biden,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/02/17/survey-more-believe-trump-would-win-2024-election-than-would-pick-biden/,"More Americans believe former President Donald Trump will win the 2024 presidential election rather than would pick President Joe Biden, should that matchup officially materialize, the latest survey from the Economist/YouGov found.

The survey asked respondents,” Regardless of who you prefer, who do you think would win the presidential election if Joe Biden were the Democratic candidate and Donald Trump were the Republican candidate?”

While the two are tied with 44 percent each in a head-to-head matchup, more believe Trump would actually emerge as the victor. Forty-five percent said they believe Trump would win, compared to 34 percent who expressed the same confidence in Biden. One in five, 21 percent, remain unsure.

Trump maintains his advantage among registered voters, specifically, as 44 percent believe he would win compared to 37 percent who said the same of Biden. Republicans are more confident that Trump would win than Democrats are confident that Biden would win, with 84 percent confidence and 73 percent confidence, respectively.

Independents are the most confident that Trump would come out on top — 45 percent to Biden’s 21 percent, a difference of 24 points. Notably, independents also side with Trump in a head-to-head matchup, giving Trump an 18-point advantage.

The survey, taken February 11-13, 2024, among 1,671 Americans, comes as more questions surface over what many believe is Biden’s deteriorating mental state. Fuel was added to the mounting concerns following a damning report released by Special Counsel Robert Hur, who found that Biden willfully retained classified material but essentially concluded that he is too mentally feeble to prosecute, providing several examples.

“We have also considered that, at trial, Mr. Biden would likely present himself to a jury, as he did during our interview of him, as a sympathetic, well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory,” the report reads in part. “Based on our direct interactions with and observations of him, he is someone for whom many jurors will want to identify reasonable doubt.”

It adds, “It would be difficult to convince a jury that they should convict him — by then a former president well into his eighties — of a serious felony that requires a mental state of willfulness.”

Further, the report also noted that Biden could not remember when he was vice president, nor when his son Beau died.
Former President Donald Trump responded to these reports during a rally in Conway, South Carolina this month.

“The special counsel’s report tries to let Biden off by claiming that he is too mentally incompetent to convict at a trial,” Trump said.

“I’m not going to charge him with a crime, but it’s okay for him to become Commander in Chief’ – think of that one,” he exclaimed, adding, “But we know that Joe Biden has always been too mentally incompetent.”",2/17/2024,HANNAH BLEAU KNUDSEN,BREITBART,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Special Counsel Robert Hur""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""presidential election""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024 presidential election""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""trial""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Economist/YouGov""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}]",-1.0
"Find Me the Votes review: Fani Willis of Georgia, the woman who could still take down Trump
",https://www.theguardian.com/books/2024/feb/18/find-me-the-votes-review-fani-willis-georgia-trump,"If this week’s hearing about Fani Willis’s affair with her assistant Nathan Wade has piqued America’s interest in the character of the Fulton county district attorney, Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman have written the perfect book for this moment.
Isikoff has been a dogged investigator for the Washington Post, NBC and Yahoo, while his longtime friend and collaborator Klaidman is a former managing editor of Newsweek now a newly minted investigative reporter for CBS. Together they have produced the most readable and authoritative account to date of all of Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

At its center is a nuanced portrait of Willis, who at least until a couple of days ago appeared to be Trump’s most effective nemesis, having indicted him, his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, as well as 16 other co-conspirators.

Whether Willis’s affair with one of her principal assistants is a valid reason to force the presiding judge to dismiss her from the case remains to be seen. But the revelation seems to have been as much of a bombshell for her biographers as it was for everyone else.

Contacted by the Guardian, both authors declined to predict the outcome of the current proceeding. But Isikoff sounded optimistic that Willis would survive this latest assault.

“How did the relationship between Willis and Wade prejudice any of the other defendants?” Isikoff asked. “There is simply no evidence that it did.”

Willis is a daughter of the civil rights movement. In the 1960s, her father, John C Floyd III, migrated from the politics of John F Kennedy and the non-violence of Martin Luther King Jr to the much tougher ideology of the Black Panther Party of Los Angeles, which he co-founded in 1967. After that he became a criminal defense and civil rights lawyer.

Isikoff and Klaidman say Floyd’s odyssey gives us “a glimpse into his daughter’s pugnacious personality and her deep-seated loathing of bullies” – both of which were on prominent display when she defended herself in the hearing room.

While it was her personal passion that brought Willis into an unwelcome spotlight, it was her own focus on allegations of sexual harassment against her previous boss and mentor that made her election as the first woman district attorney of Fulton county possible. Paul Howard became the first Black person to hold the job of Fulton county DA in 1996, and made Willis a star by giving her some of his Atlanta office’s most famous cases. She became famous as the lead prosecutor in an indictment of 35 public school officials for alleged violations of Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (Rico) Act. The Atlanta schools superintendent, six principals, two assistant principals and 14 teachers were accused of faking students’ test scores, in response to the requirements of No Child Left Behind.

That law, championed by George W Bush, put schools at risk of losing federal aid if students didn’t meet minimum standards for success on standardized tests. All but one of the defendants was Black, which made the prosecution even more controversial. By the time Howard gave Willis the case she was chief of the office’s trial division. Isikoff and Klaidman say she proved a “hands-on micromanager” who “plunged into every detail of the case”. Its complexity turned out to be the perfect training for Willis to use the same Rico statute to go after Donald Trump and his co-conspirators.

One of this book’s most important contributions is to remind us of the breadth and viciousness of the president’s efforts to undermine democracy – and the horrendous effects they had on the lives of decent, honest election officials in every swing state Trump lost.

After multiple lawsuits alleging voter fraud were thrown out by nearly every judge who heard them, Trump famously turned his attention to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, one of several Republicans whose resistance proved heroic. When Trump got Raffensperger and his assistants on the phone, they were shocked by how many QAnon conspiracy theories Trump seemed to have accepted as fact – just because so many of his supporters had retweeted them. A particular favorite of the president’s was the notion there had been 200,000 forged signatures on absentee ballots in Fulton county – even though the total number of absentee votes had been 148,319.
In the same call, Trump repeated the big lie that the Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and Wandrea “Shaye” Moss had run between 18,000 and 56,000 bogus ballots through election scanners. Trump said Freeman was “known all over the internet”. This was the same lie promoted by Giuliani, which ultimately cost him a richly deserved verdict of $148m for libeling the two innocent women.
In one of the many telling details of Isikoff and Klaidman’s book, the authors remind us that the other hero from that phone call was the Georgia deputy secretary of state, Jordan Fuchs.

“Fuchs did what was arguably the single gutsiest and most consequential act of the entire post-election battle,” the authors believe. To protect her boss, she decided to tape the phone call – without telling Raffensperger. After the tape leaked to the Washington Post, it quickly became the single most powerful piece of evidence against the ex-president in any of the four prosecutions he is still facing.

When you see all of Trump’s alleged crimes piled together in a single narrative, it is beyond belief that he remains the favorite of a majority of Republican primary voters. But these same facts should surely be enough to guarantee his defeat if he actually gets the chance to face the larger electorate in November.",2/18/2024,Charles Kaiser,The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""America""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Michael Isikoff""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Rudy Giuliani""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Daniel Klaidman""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Guardian""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""CBS""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Yahoo""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""White House""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Fulton county""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Fani Willis""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Black Panther Party of Los Angeles""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""NBC""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Mark Meadows""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Newsweek""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Washington Post""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Nathan Wade""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020 election""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""John C Floyd III""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""John F Kennedy""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Martin Luther King Jr""}]",0.42
Europe is nervous about a potential Trump win. China sees an opportunity,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/19/asia/europe-is-nervous-about-a-potential-trump-win-china-sees-an-opportunity/index.html,"China’s top diplomat Wang Yi had a message for his European counterparts over the weekend: no matter how the world changes, China will be “consistent and stable” – a “force for stability.”

The claim, which Wang delivered during remarks at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, comes as European leaders are warily watching the upcoming United States elections – concerned that the potential return of former President Donald Trump could upend their partnership with Washington.

Those concerns flared in the past week after Trump said he would not defend NATO allies that failed to spend enough on defense – a stunning threat for many in Europe as Russia’s invasion grinds on in Ukraine.

The timing of Trump’s comments couldn’t have been better for Wang, who is visiting Europe as Beijing struggles to repair deteriorating relations with the bloc — an effort made more urgent by its domestic economic struggles and ongoing frictions with the US.

“No matter how the world changes, China, as a responsible major country, will keep its major principles and policies consistent and stable and serve as a staunch force for stability in a turbulent world,” Wang said during remarks in Munich, while calling for China and Europe to “stay clear of geopolitical and ideological distractions” and work together.

But while Wang’s pitch may land on receptive ears in some European capitals where leaders hope to stabilize aspects of their relations with China, Beijing also has a major issue when it comes to making real progress to repair ties, analysts say: its steadfast relationship with Moscow.

Those challenges were underscored over the weekend in Munich, where the security conference was overshadowed by shock and anger as reports emerged of the death at age 47 of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny.

Leaders decried his death as the work of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s regime – with outrage amplifying mounting concern about the fate of Ukraine, which lost key ground to Russia on Friday.

“Wang’s message to his European hosts is that geopolitical differences should not be allowed to get in the way of close cooperation,” said Noah Barkin, a visiting senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States (GMF) think tank.

“What is left unsaid is that China is not prepared to change the positions and policies that worry the Europeans most, namely its deepening relationship with Russia and its distortive trade practices.” Russia relations
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began two years ago, Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have bolstered their countries’ relations as both face rising tensions with the West. China – which has not condemned Russia’s invasion and claims impartiality in the conflict – has also emerged as a key lifeline for the sanctions-hit Russian economy.
In Europe, this has galvanized concerns about China’s own global ambitions and played a role in the European Union’s ongoing push to recalibrate its policy toward China.

In a panel discussion in Munich on Saturday, NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg drew a parallel between Russian aggression and China, saying continued American support for Ukraine would “send a message” to Xi discouraging potential use of force in Taiwan, a self-ruled island China’s ruling Communist Party claims.

EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell reiterated the bloc’s “expectation that China refrains from supporting Russia,” in a meeting with Wang Friday. Western governments have not accused Beijing of sending extensive aid to Russia’s military. he EU is considering placing trade restrictions on three mainland Chinese firms as part of a proposed round of measures meant to hamper the Russian war effort, Bloomberg reported last week.

In response to a query about the report from CNN, China’s Foreign Ministry said it “firmly opposes illegal sanctions or ‘long-arm jurisdiction’ against China under the pretext of China-Russia cooperation” and that “normal exchanges” between Chinese and Russian enterprises “are not targeted at any third party.”

Wang made an apparent attempt to address concerns about China’s ties to Russia over the weekend, framing the relationship for his audience in Munich as part of Beijing’s efforts to cooperate with “major countries” to address global challenges.

“Russia is China’s largest neighboring country,” Wang said, repeating usual statements that their relationship is not an alliance and does not “target any third party.” As such, “a China-Russia relationship that grows steadily … meets the shared interests of the two countries” and “serves the strategic stability of the Asia-Pacific and the world,” he said.

When asked by conference chairman Christoph Heusgen in a public discussion whether China should do more to rein in Russia, Wang also hit back at what he claimed were attempts “to blame China or to shift the responsibility of resolving the Ukraine crisis to China.” Beijing has worked “relentlessly” to promote peace talks, he said. The diplomat reiterated as much in a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart Dmytro Kuleba on Saturday, stressing that China does not “sell lethal weapons to conflict areas or parties of conflict” and that it would “not give up its efforts” to re-establish peace.

But those efforts have fallen well short of European hopes that China would use its considerable economic leverage and regular high-level communication with Russia, including between Xi and Putin, to end the conflict in a way that respected Ukraine’s territorial integrity.

Instead, a push from Beijing to frame itself as a potential peacemaker in the conflict, spearheaded by Wang at last year’s Munich Security Conference, hasn’t produced tangible results. A plan for a “political settlement” of the conflict put forward by Beijing at that time was widely criticized as likely to help Moscow consolidate its territorial gains, as it called for a ceasefire without the prior withdrawal of Russian troops.

It’s also unclear whether Beijing will attend an upcoming Ukraine-backed Global Peace Summit in Switzerland. Kuleba raised the event in his meeting with Wang, according to a statement on the Ukrainian diplomat’s X account. Beijing’s readout did not mention the event. The ‘Trump factor’
Observers say that against this backdrop, Wang’s apparent attempts to dial down European concerns about China’s position relative to the war may have little impact within the EU.

“As long as war in Ukraine continues, EU policies toward China will move into closer alignment with the US. Most likely, Europeans will join the US to double down export restrictions over critical technologies in light of viewing the Union’s economic security as paramount,” according to Yu Jie, a senior research fellow on China at the Chatham House think tank in London.

The bloc is considering a host of measures that would help it to “de-risk” European supply chains from China, secure critical technologies and protect its market from what it sees as certain artificially cheap Chinese goods. Beijing sees European policy as excessively influenced by the United States.

Wang also attempted to push back against such measures in Munich, warning that “those who attempt to shut China out in the name of ‘de-risking’ will make a historic mistake.”

The Chinese diplomat met a number of European counterparts on the sidelines of the security conference, before continuing on to Spain. He is also due to visit France this week. Wang may see more success in stabilizing relations with individual EU member states interested in boosting economic ties — and those looking with uncertainty at the impending US elections, according to observers.

In his European meetings, Wang may “utilize the ‘Trump factor’ to point out that completely siding with the United States is not in the best interests of European countries,” according to Liu Dongshu, an assistant professor in the City University of Hong Kong’s department of public and international affairs.

As president, Trump not only voiced skepticism of the system of US alliances in Europe, but leveraged tariffs on European steel and aluminum, sparking retaliatory measures on US goods from Europe.

“Wang Yi may point out that … if Trump becomes president it will be a problem if (Europe) doesn’t have a good relationship with China … He wants to persuade the European countries to be more neutral,” Liu said.

Beijing has made some progress in smoothing relations with European countries in the past year, including during a visit to China from French President Emmanuel Macron last spring – a development Wang will hope to build on.

“In national capitals, there will be a greater focus on keeping the relationship with Beijing stable, in part to head off the risk of a two-front trade conflict with Beijing and Washington, should Trump return to the White House,” said Barkin of GMF, who is also a senior adviser at the New York-based Rhodium Group.

Donald Trump hogs the limelight at conservative conference,https://www.dw.com/en/donald-trump-hogs-the-limelight-at-conservative-conference/a-68367516,"CPAC, the annual conference of US conservatives, is already celebrating Donald Trump as the country's next president, and he's winning over many supporters. The staid hallways of the Gaylord Convention Center in Maryland have disappeared behind the colorful decorations and outlandish outfits of the people in the crowds. It's the last day of the Conservative Political Action Conference, or CPAC for short, a yearly event that brings together conservative activists and representatives to exchange ideas.

Many visitors have arrived decorated in glitter, their clothing adorned with bright colors and stars-and-stripes motifs. They wear the US flag on T-shirts, overalls or, like Roberta Sikkelee Curtain, on their shoes.

""I'm here to support Donald Trump and Jesus Christ. We don't want somebody from the establishment in office, we the people,"" she told DW.

Her red dress has ""MAGA"" emblazoned on it, the abbreviation of Trump's favorite slogan: ""Make America Great Again."" The slogan is omnipresent.MAGA fans already proclaiming Trump as the winner
It's easy to forget that the Republican presidential candidate hasn't even officially been decided yet. As CPAC was taking place, people in South Carolina voted in the Republican primary election for their presidential candidate.

South Carolina is the home state of Nikki Haley, the only remaining contender for the Republican nomination besides Trump. But even before the results were announced in the evening, Trump was declared the winner by many attendees. Nevertheless, Haley confirmed on Saturday that she did not want to drop out of the race, despite results that showed the former president taking around 60% of the vote in the primary.

""I'm definitely going to vote for Trump. Haley is not going to be popular enough,"" said Kevin Miller, 19, a member of the Republican Club at Hope College, a private Christian school in Michigan. ""But more than that, Trump is more confident and that is where a lot of people base their votes."" Miller is a fan of Trump's foreign policy, he said, especially when it comes to border issues. ""We've had them open long enough, we can close them,"" he told DW.

He also claims the US was involved in fewer wars under the former president, which he attributes to Trump's tone. Though it's true that Trump did not get the US involved in any new wars during his presidency, he did continue most of the military operations started by his predecessors, especially in the Middle East. He also expanded the military use of drones.

'Globalism is going to die!'
Meanwhile, on the main stage, organizer Matt Schlapp spoke and fired up the crowd. ""Who is ready to save America? Globalism is going to die!"" he shouted, amid clapping and chants of ""USA!"" Then the announcer introduced the ""next president of the United States,"" as Trump himself took the stage. The 77-year-old right-wing populist used his speech to present himself as the savior of an America that has slipped into chaos and crime under Biden's presidency. It was a bold claim, one not supported by crime statistics.

A vote for him is a vote for freedom, said Trump, before referring to his own legal situation. A series of civil and criminal cases could result in jail time for the twice impeached Republican.

'We can't let the Democrats win'
Even at first glance, Israel Markowitz, wearing a T-shirt bearing the slogan ""Jews for Trump,"" looks like an ultra-Trump fan. In the primaries, however, Markowitz said he would have preferred to vote for Haley.

""I think she has a better character. She is the opposite of him, he is a nasty person,"" he said. But that won't stop Markowitz from voting for Trump now that he no longer sees any chance of Haley succeeding. ""I have to support our nominee because we can't let the Democrats win."" Markowitz isn't the only one at the conference who didn't favor Trump from the start. CPAC attendee Brandon Weichert also originally backed Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, before Trump's speech won him over.

""He reminded me of the Trump of 2016. He was having fun, he's a fighter. He is somebody who is gonna push ahead, no matter what and I respect that,"" said Weichert.

Moreover, Trump's record as president also speaks in his favor, according to Weichert, who thinks the people at CPAC associate Haley with the establishment, the corporatists and the globalists. ""It's not her time. Trump is the guy,"" he told DW.

Participants from all over the world, including Europe
CPAC isn't only attended by Americans. As well as Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei, who is currently trying to give his country a liberal economic overhaul, also spoke at the conference, along with other conservative delegations from all over the world. Weichert said he had also seen participants from several European countries, including members of the German far-right Alternative for Germany. Monica Cotenescu of Romania's Republican Party has come to network with international conservatives — and to meet ""Mr. Trump.""

""He's a showman, he makes people applaud him, he makes people love him,"" she said.

Meanwhile, at a simultaneous alternative event, moderate conservatives were meeting at the Principles First Summit in Washington. Some of them spoke out against Trump, including the event's founder Heath Mayo. The day before the conference, Mayo told DW that he fears Trump's victory could be accompanied by a transformation of his party.

""It'll be a party of isolationism, it will be a party of conspiracy theories, about the deep state being arrayed against average Americans,"" he said. But he trusts that his country will prevent Trump's victory.

Trump chose his speaking venue very deliberately. He was at CPAC because, for him, the conference is no longer just a gathering of conservatives but an association of like-minded people, or as he said in his speech: ""a group of people with common sense.""

Trump certainly got the people at CPAC on his side. This year's conference was guided by the MAGA mantra: It's supposed to make America ""great"" and more conservative — with Trump in charge.

"Michigan primary puts major battleground state in play for 2024
",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michigan-primary-puts-major-battleground-state-play-2024,"Polls have closed in Michigan, where voters had the chance Tuesday to cast their ballots in the state-run primary elections for both Republican and Democrat presidential candidates.

Democrat primary voters were able to choose from President Biden and his challengers, Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota and author Marianne Williamson. Those voters will also have the option to cast an ""uncommitted"" vote.

Meanwhile, Republican voters on Tuesday had a choice between former President Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, the only two GOP candidates left in the race, though others who have since dropped out appeared on the ballot, including former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy and former Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. There are 16 delegates at stake.

TRUMP SAYS SOUTH CAROLINA IS 'BIGGER WIN THAN WE ANTICIPATED,' LOOKS FORWARD TO SAYING 'JOE, YOU'RE FIRED'



Michigan's Democrat-controlled legislature set the state's primary date earlier than usual this year to comply with the wishes of the Democratic National Committee. But shifting the date for the Democrats pushed the Republicans out of compliance with the Republican National Committee (RNC). 

To avoid a penalty from the RNC, Michigan Republicans came up with a split-primary system, with voters casting ballots on Tuesday and on March 2.

TRUMP 'REALLY NOT THINKING ABOUT' HALEY AFTER SOUTH CAROLINA VICTORY, SAYS HE'S FOCUSED ON BEATING BIDEN

On Saturday, the Michigan GOP will hold a party-run convention in Detroit. The winner of that contest could receive up to 39 delegates, although they will be distributed by district. There are 13 total districts and three delegates per district. 

During that contest, voters only have the choice between Trump and Haley.

Michigan has a total of 55 pledged delegates.

Trump previously dominated the Iowa Caucuses, left New Hampshire with a commanding victory, swept the caucuses in Nevada and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and then won South Carolina with a ""bigger win"" than he anticipated, he said.

""I’m very honored by the elections,"" he told Fox News Digital during an exclusive interview after his South Carolina victory on Saturday. ""We're setting records in every single state.""

Trump on Saturday looked ahead to Michigan and predicted a victory because ""the autoworkers are going to be with us 100% because they got sold out by this country."" 

Haley, despite losing another contest — this time in her home state of South Carolina — vowed to stay in the race.

Michigan’s government is under full control by the Democrats.

Republicans dominated in Michigan elections from 1972 through 1988. But the state became part of a so-called ""blue wall"" that backed Democrat nominees in six straight presidential elections from 1972 through 2012.

"Haley says Trump should not be 'entirely immune' from criminal penalties
",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haley-says-trump-should-not-be-entirely-immune-from-criminal-penalties,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump's 2024 Republican primary rival Nikki Haley is backing the Supreme Court's decision to take up his immunity case and ""settle it once and for all,"" arguing that commanders-in-chief should not be ""entirely immune"" from criminal penalties.

""The Supreme Court should take up this question and settle it once and for all. No person should be entirely immune from penalties for crimes committed, not even a president – not Clinton, not Biden, and not Trump,"" Haley told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

In a win for the former president, the court agreed to review whether he has immunity from prosecution in the Special Counsel's federal election interference case. The court, stacked with three justices nominated by Trump, moved to expedite the matter, planning to begin arguments the week of April 22 and producing a ruling by late June. Trump's criminal trial has been put on hold pending resolution of the matter.

Sen. Ron Johnson R-Wis., applauded the development, telling Fox News Digital, ""The fact that the Supreme Court took it up is pretty telling.""

Discussing the delay in Trump's federal election interference case as a result, Johnson claimed, ""I think these very partisan prosecutions, that's what they're designed to do."" The Supreme Court's agreement to hear the appeal is likely to push Trump's federal trial into the late summer or early fall, not far from the November presidential election.

""They are election interference to a far greater extent than anything Russia or China ever could hope to accomplish,"" he continued.

The senator was hopeful the court's choice signaled some resistance to the ""election interference,"" but noted, ""We'll see how the Supreme Court rules.""

Trump foes, meanwhile, criticized the Supreme Court for being willing to hear the case.

Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., claimed the court is ""placing itself on trial"" with the decision and questioned ""whether the justices will uphold the fundamental American value that no one is above the law – not even a former president.""

Former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., also slammed the court's plan to review Trump's claim of presidential immunity. ""Delaying the January 6 trial suppresses critical evidence that Americans deserve to hear,"" she wrote on X.

""Donald Trump attempted to overturn an election and seize power. Our justice system must be able to bring him to trial before the next election. SCOTUS should decide this case promptly,"" she added.

Cheney was a part of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack before her House term ended. She ran for reelection but was defeated in her Republican primary by Rep. Harriet Hageman. R-Wyo.

An impeachment manager for Trump's second impeachment trial, Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., predicted the Supreme Court taking up the case could help guarantee a ""blue wave"" in November.

The US president faced no real primary challenger in the contest. But a campaign that formed just weeks before the primary to vote “uncommitted” in protest of his continued support for Israel’s war in Gaza signaled the fury and betrayal some Arab American and younger voters in the state feel for Biden.
The group pushing for voters to choose “uncommitted” – called Listen to Michigan – set the goal of 10,000 uncommitted votes in the primary. By Wednesday morning, “uncommitted” had received more than 100,000 votes – 13.3% of the vote.

For context, when the then president, Barack Obama, ran uncontested in the 2012 race, about 21,000 voted “uncommitted” against him in Michigan’s primary, with about 194,000 voting in total – just over 9% of voters.

Trump narrowly won the state by just 11,000 votes in 2016 and organisers of the “uncommitted” effort wanted to show that they have at least the number of votes that were Trump’s margin of victory in 2016, to demonstrate how influential the bloc can be.

As results came in after polls closed at 8pm, members of the Listen to Michigan campaign gathered at a banquet hall in Dearborn and declared the results a victory for their campaign. Attendees embraced and celebrated, many wearing the black and white keffiyeh.

Before handing the microphone off to a series of speakers for the campaign, Abbas Alawieh, a Listen to Michigan spokesperson, held a moment’s silence “for every human life that has been taken from us too soon using US taxpayer funds and bombs”.


“Thank you to our local and national progressive organizations and our voters of conscience, who used our democratic process to vote against war, genocide and the destruction of a people and a land,” said Layla Elabed, who launched the campaign in early February.

The former congressman Andy Levin, an early and prominent local supporter of the push to vote “uncommitted”, called the movement “a child of necessity” and said the turnout so far was “a huge victory”.

“There is no hope for security and peace for the Jewish people without security and peace and freedom and justice for the Palestinian people,” said Levin, to cheers.
The Listen to Michigan campaign was intended as a warning for Biden to revise his so far unwavering support for Israel’s campaign in Gaza, which has killed nearly 30,000 Palestinians, ahead of the general election. The campaign is especially significant in Michigan given the state’s large Arab American population, a group that supported Biden strongly in 2020.

But it is not clear what share of “uncommitted” voters are prepared to abandon Biden in the general election this November, when he will most likely face Donald Trump – who is campaigning on a pledge to reinstate and expand his Muslim travel ban.

There were some warning signs for Trump in his victory in Michigan, too. Early reporting out of Kent county, which flipped to Biden in the 2020 presidential election, showed Trump with a slimmer margin of victory – in an area that is significant to the conservative movement and home to the conservative mega-donors the DeVoses.

“You can’t win a general election if you don’t acknowledge the 40% of Republicans who are saying we don’t want Donald Trump,” said Haley at a press conference in Grand Rapids ahead of the primary, referring to the share of Republican voters in South Carolina who voted for her.

A day before the primary, Biden announced a ceasefire could come as soon as Monday – but both Hamas and Israeli officials denied that negotiations had progressed substantially.

In a statement on Tuesday night, Biden did not address the Listen to Michigan campaign or the growing tally of voters who cast their ballots as “uncommitted”, instead touting his record on labor and warning that Trump was “threatening to drag us even further into the past as he pursues revenge and retribution”.",2/28/2024,"Alice Herman,  Oliver Laughland ",The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""primary""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Barack Obama""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Dearborn""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Democratic primary""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Gaza""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Jeff Kowalsky""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Israel""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Abbas Alawieh""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""US""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""progressive organizations""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Michigan""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2012 race""}]",0.57
"Michigan primary takeaways: Biden, Trump win but Gaza protest sends message
",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/2/28/michigan-primary-takeaways,"President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have easily won their parties’ primaries in Michigan but results show that both candidates have cause for concern in their bids to win the swing state in November amid a rising number of “uncommitted” voters.

Here are some key takeaways from the Michigan primaries:

1. Biden, Trump each move closer to presidential nomination
Michigan was the last major state to hold a primary before Super Tuesday next week and both sides were watching closely for any early indications for the November general election in one of the few genuine swing states left in the country.

Biden has now cruised to victories over lesser-known Democrat candidates in South Carolina, Nevada and New Hampshire. The latest result shows that his standing is still strong in Michigan as well.

Trump has swept all five of the early state Republican contests for the presidential nomination, including South Carolina, the home state of rival Nikki Haley. He heads towards Super Tuesday, when 15 states and one territory will hold Republican nominating contests, as the overwhelming favourite.

Michigan was one of three so-called blue wall states, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that Trump won in 2016.

2. Democrats express anger over Israel’s war on Gaza with ‘uncommitted’ vote
Michigan has become the focal point of Democratic frustration over the White House’s handling of Israel’s war on Gaza. It has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the nation.

That anger came through loud and clear on Tuesday as thousands of voters marked “uncommitted” on their ballot in the Democratic primary. Biden still dominated the primary, but the result could be a concern in a state he won by less than 3 percent in 2020 and likely can’t afford to lose this year.

Listen to Michigan, a campaign started and spearheaded by predominantly younger Arab and Muslim organisers, led a push for Democrats to choose “uncommitted” in the primary as a protest vote.

“My message for Biden is that you have voters here in Michigan for whom his handling of Gaza is the top issue on our mind – so many of us are survivors of war ourselves,” Abbas Alawieh, spokesman for Listen to Michigan told Al Jazeera.
“It’s long past time for the President to do two things; one, call for a permanent ceasefire and, two, stop funding the genocide. Both of those demands are urgent, there are especially urgent for me as someone who was a congressional staffer on January 6, and who knows how dangerous Donald Trump is.

“It’s precisely for that reason that we set our campaign goal to be 10,000 votes because in 2016, the last time Donald Trump won, he won by 10,000 votes.

“Say it publicly: President Joe Biden, what are you waiting for, 13,000 children gone, using our taxpayer funds and bombs, it needs to stop and he needs to listen to Michigan,” Alawieh said.

With almost half of Democrat votes counted, the number of “uncommitted” voters was already more than 58,000, according to Edison Research, far exceeding that target of 10,000.

According to analysts, this protest could turn into a serious problem for Biden during the presidential election.

“It could be a significant problem … [if protesters] decide not to come out when the races against Donald Trump vs Joe Biden [starts],” John Feehery, a partner at EFB advocacy, a lobbying and strategic communications firm and political commentator, told Al Jazeera.

“This is going to be a really key test for Joe Biden, I think that’s why you see him trying to put additional pressure on Netanyahu and the Israelis to get these deals and kind of clean this war up or get this war over with,” he added.

3. Some Republicans still oppose Trump
Despite Trump’s clear victory in Michigan, Haley still saw significant support from the swing state’s Republicans.

Some of her best results came in Oakland and Kent counties, where Democrats have been gaining ground in recent years, contributing to their recent statewide success. She also performed better in counties where the state’s largest universities are located – in Washtenaw and Ingham. She secured 26.5 percent of the vote.

The former president has appeared in Michigan regularly in the eight years since he became president, while Haley only began campaigning in the state over the weekend.

But securing the backing of around 30 percent of Republicans in Michigan who either voted for Haley or chose the GOP’s “uncommitted” option remains a challenge for Trump, political analysts say. Despite being close to winning his third presidential nomination in a few weeks, a significant group either opposes him or remains unconvinced.

Feehery said: “Trump has got some issues in some of the more suburban countings surrounding Detroit, where the higher income do not like Trump, and they do like Nikki Haley; he also has some problems in the west side of the state, and he has to shore that up because he needs a united party to be able to beat Joe Biden in the general election.”

4. However, Haley is running out of time
Haley has promised to continue her campaign at least until after Super Tuesday on March 5, pointing to a not-insignificant swath of Republican primary voters who have continued to support her despite Trump’s tightening grip on the Republican party.

She also raised nearly $3m more than Trump’s primary campaign committee in January. That indicates that some donors continue to look at Haley, despite her “long-shot” prospects, as an alternative to Trump, should his legal problems imperil his chances of becoming the nominee.

Nevertheless, Haley once again fell short of securing the decisive victory that could shift momentum in her favour. Instead of expanding, her margins are diminishing as time dwindles.

Listen to Michigan, a campaign started and spearheaded by predominantly younger Arab and Muslim organisers led a push for Democrats to vote uncommitted in the primary as a protest vote.

"Haley slams Trump for Senate losses, calls out GOP lawmakers for courting him",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haley-slams-trump-for-senate-losses-calls-out-gop-lawmakers-for-courting-him,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley blamed former President Trump Friday for recent Republican losses in critical electoral races, including those for seats in the Senate, while expressing hope the GOP's new leader in the upper chamber is focused on setting a tone rather than courting Trump. 

""You're seeing the wave of what Congress thinks they need to do to win,"" Haley told reporters during a briefing at the Fairmont Hotel in Washington's Georgetown neighborhood.

Haley was likely referencing Trump's dominance over the House and Senate relative to endorsements and influence. 

But Haley suggested lawmakers who cater to the former president are misguided because Republicans have lost pivotal matchups since his presidency.

""All of these losses happened after Donald Trump became president in 2016,"" she said, noting gubernatorial, federal and statewide losses in Michigan, Minnesota and Virginia. 

Haley claimed the only reason Gov. Glenn Youngkin, R-Va., was elected in 2021 was because ""he distanced himself"" from Trump. 

Youngkin's political team declined to comment to Fox News Digital. 

""It’s not an accurate statement,"" according to Zack Roday, a former Youngkin adviser and partner at Ascent Media.

""Glenn Youngkin won because he built a movement and coalition of Republicans, independents and even Democrats who wanted a new direction for Virginia."" 

Despite the losses, Haley claimed members of the House and Senate are now ""falling all over themselves to show that they're more Trump than everybody else."" 

Haley weighed in on what the next Senate Republican leader should bring to the table after Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's surprise announcement Wednesday that he's stepping down. She didn't suggest any specific senators for the role but explained she wants a leader focused on the people and ""not rewarding people for peacocking on TV.""

""I want to see somebody inspirational. I want to see somebody that says, ‘You know what, we can do things differently,'"" Haley said. ""My hope is that we will. But we'll have to see.""

Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told Fox News Digital the campaign's focus is now on Biden and the general election.

""Republican voters have delivered resounding wins for President Trump in every single primary contest, and this race is over,"" she said.

"Miami Mayor, former White House hopeful Francis Suarez endorses Donald Trump for president",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/miami-mayor-former-white-house-hopeful-francis-suarez-endorses-donald-trump-president,"Miami Mayor and former Republican presidential candidate Francis Suarez announced Friday his endorsement of former President Donald Trump for re-election this year.

In an early morning post on X, Suarez, who leads one of the biggest cities in the U.S. with one of the most concentrated populations of Hispanic Americans, vowed to help boost Trump and the Republican Party with Latino, young and urban voters.

""After seeing both our current President and President Trump at the border, and having been there myself last week, it is evident to me that the only candidate that will keep our country safe, our border secured, reduce inflation and can coherently lead our country forward is President Donald J. Trump,"" Suarez wrote.

""For those reasons, I am endorsing President Trump today. I look forward to helping him campaign on his strong record and contrast it with the current administration's. I especially look forward to helping President Trump and the Republican Party win a larger share of Hispanic, young voters and voters across our cities and urban centers,"" he added.

Suarez's endorsement comes on the heels of polling showing the Democrat Party losing support from Hispanic voters, including in a Gallup poll released last month that found Republicans only trailing with the community by 12 points, the lowest since 2011.

That same poll also found younger voters supporting Democrats at their lowest level in almost two decades.

According to a USA Today/Suffolk University poll released in January, Biden's support among Hispanic voters had fallen to 34% from 59%.

Suarez's endorsement also comes a day after Trump and President Biden held dueling events at the southern border, although the latter was rebuked for choosing to visit Brownsville, Texas, an area much less affected by the spiraling migrant crisis than Eagle Pass, Texas, where the former visited.

"Trump says Texas governor Greg Abbott ‘absolutely’ on vice-president shortlist
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/01/trump-greg-abbott-vice-president-short-list,"Greg Abbott, the hard-right governor of Texas, is “absolutely” on Donald Trump’s shortlist for vice-president should Trump as expected win the Republican nomination to face Joe Biden.
Calling Abbott a “spectacular man”, Trump told Sean Hannity of Fox News the three-term governor, an anti-immigration extremist, had “done a great job”, adding: “Yeah, certainly he would be somebody that I would very much consider.”

“So he’s on the list?” Hannity said.

“Absolutely, he is,” Trump said, as Abbott listened.

Abbott has engineered showdowns with Democratic authorities, sending undocumented migrants to Democratic-run cities, and with the federal government, blocking border patrol access to the Rio Grande river at a common crossing point for migrants, then refusing to comply with orders to back off.

“He really stepped it up,” Trump said of Abbott on Thursday, during a visit to the spot in question, a park in Eagle Pass, part of a Texas trip the same day Biden visited the border elsewhere.

Abbott, Trump said, had “been amazing”.

Abbott, however, told CNN last week “there’s so many people other than myself who are best situated” to be Trump’s running mate, adding that he would help Trump pick. On Wednesday, Abbott told CBS he intended to run for a fourth term in Texas.

At Trump’s direction, Republicans are attempting to use conditions at the southern border for political gain in an election year, to the extent of the congressional GOP blocking a hardline, bipartisan deal negotiated in the Senate.

In his own border trip, Biden said Trump should “join me” in addressing the problem.

Trump’s dominance of his party is near-complete. This week he enjoyed a major victory when Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Republican Senate leader since 2006 but at odds with Trump since the attack on Congress of 6 January 2021, said he would step down this year.

In Texas, Trump said Abbott should replace McConnell.

“I’d rather be governor of Texas,” Abbott said.

“I think you’re doing well,” Trump said. “I want to keep you in Texas.”
Trump is all but certain to again capture the Republican presidential nomination, having won all primary contests and with the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley, his last opponent, seen as likely to drop out after Super Tuesday next week.

Trump enjoys such dominance despite facing 91 criminal charges from four indictments, multimillion-dollar civil reversals over his business affairs and an allegation of rape a judge called “substantially true”, and attempts to remove him from the ballot for inciting January 6, most recently in Illinois.

Informal auditions for Trump’s running mate continue.

Hannity asked Trump about his shortlist. Trump gave a less-than-glowing assessment of the presidential campaign mounted by the South Carolina senator Tim Scott, who dropped out early and pivoted to fawning support.

“Tim, for himself, he was fine,” Trump said. “He did OK. I mean, he was OK as a candidate, but he didn’t want to talk about himself. He’s a very good man. For me, he’s unbelievable. He’s a surrogate.”

Other candidates Trump has mentioned include Kristi Noem, governor of South Dakota; Elise Stefanik of New York, the No 3 House Republican; the biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, a former primary rival; Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii; and Byron Donalds, a far-right congressman from Florida.

Others said to be in the running include JD Vance, a populist senator from Ohio; Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the governor of Arkansas who was Trump’s second White House press secretary; and Katie Britt, a senator from Alabama.",3/1/2024,Martin Pengelly ,The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Sean Hannity""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""border patrol""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Rio Grande""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Fox News""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Mitch McConnell""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Texas""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""GOP""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""southern border""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Greg Abbott""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""CBS""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democratic authorities""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Kentucky""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Senate""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Eagle Pass""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""CNN""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Congress""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""federal government""}]",0.57
"Voters Doubt Biden’s Leadership and Favor Trump, Times/Siena Poll Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/02/us/politics/biden-trump-times-siena-poll.html,"President Biden is struggling to overcome doubts about his leadership inside his own party and broad dissatisfaction over the nation’s direction, leaving him trailing behind Donald J. Trump just as their general-election contest is about to begin, a new poll by The New York Times and Siena College has found.

With eight months left until the November election, Mr. Biden’s 43 percent support lags behind Mr. Trump’s 48 percent in the national survey of registered voters.

Only one in four voters thinks the country is moving in the right direction. More than twice as many voters believe Mr. Biden’s policies have personally hurt them as believe his policies have helped them. A majority of voters think the economy is in poor condition. And the share of voters who strongly disapprove of Mr. Biden’s handling of his job has reached 47 percent, higher than in Times/Siena polls at any point in his presidency.

The poll offers an array of warning signs for the president about weaknesses within the Democratic coalition, including among women, Black and Latino voters. So far, it is Mr. Trump who has better unified his party, even amid an ongoing primary contest.

Mr. Biden has marched through the early nominating states with only nominal opposition. But the poll showed that Democrats remain deeply divided about the prospect of Mr. Biden, the 81-year-old chief executive, leading the party again. About as many Democratic primary voters said Mr. Biden should not be the nominee in 2024 as said he should be — with opposition strongest among voters younger than 45 years old.

Mr. Trump’s ability to consolidate the Republican base better than Mr. Biden has unified the base of his own party shows up starkly in the current thinking of 2020 voters. Mr. Trump is winning 97 percent of those who say they voted for him four years ago, and virtually none of his past supporters said they are casting a ballot for Mr. Biden. In contrast, Mr. Biden is winning only 83 percent of his 2020 voters, with 10 percent saying they now back Mr. Trump.

“It’s going to be a very tough decision — I’m seriously thinking about not voting,” said Mamta Misra, 57, a Democrat and an economics professor in Lafayette, La., who voted for Mr. Biden in 2020. “Trump voters are going to come out no matter what. For Democrats, it’s going to be bad. I don’t know why they’re not thinking of someone else.”

Mr. Trump’s five-point lead in the survey, which was conducted in late February, is slightly larger than in the last Times/Siena national poll of registered voters in December. Among the likely electorate, Mr. Trump currently leads by four percentage points.

In last year’s survey, Mr. Trump led by two points among registered voters and Mr. Biden led by two points among the projected likely electorate.

One of the more ominous findings for Mr. Biden in the new poll is that the historical edge Democrats have held with working-class voters of color who did not attend college continues to erode.

Mr. Biden won 72 percent of those voters in 2020, according to exit polling, providing him with a nearly 50-point edge over Mr. Trump. Today, the Times/Siena poll showed Mr. Biden only narrowly leading among nonwhite voters who did not graduate from college: 47 percent to 41 percent.

An excitement gap between the two parties shows up repeatedly in the survey: Only 23 percent of Democratic primary voters said they were enthusiastic about Mr. Biden — half the share of Republicans who said they were about Mr. Trump. Significantly more Democrats said they were either dissatisfied or angry at Mr. Biden being the leader of the party (32 percent) than Republicans who said the same about Mr. Trump (18 percent).

Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden are unpopular. Mr. Trump had a weak 44 percent favorable rating; Mr. Biden fared even worse, at 38 percent. Among the 19 percent of voters who said they disapproved of both likely nominees — an unusually large cohort in 2024 that pollsters and political strategists sometimes call “double haters” — Mr. Biden actually led Mr. Trump, 45 percent to 33 percent.

The candidate who had won such “double haters” was victorious in the elections in both 2016 and 2020.

For now, though, unhappiness with the state of the country is plainly a drag on Mr. Biden’s prospects. Two-thirds of the country feels the nation is headed in the wrong direction — and Mr. Trump is winning 63 percent of those voters.

The share of voters who believe the nation is on the right track remains a dismal and diminutive minority at 24 percent. Yet even that figure is a marked improvement from the peak inflationary days in the summer of 2022, when only 13 percent of voters felt the nation was headed in the proper direction.

“If we get Trump for another four years, we get a little better on economics,” said Oscar Rivera, a 39-year-old independent voter who owns a roofing business in Rochester, N.Y.

Mr. Trump’s policies were generally viewed far more favorably by voters than Mr. Biden’s. A full 40 percent of voters said Mr. Trump’s policies had helped them personally, compared to only 18 percent who said the same of Mr. Biden’s.

Only 12 percent of independent voters like Mr. Rivera said Mr. Biden’s policies had personally helped them, compared to 43 percent who said his policies had hurt them.

Mr. Rivera, who is Puerto Rican, said he doesn’t like the way Mr. Trump talks about immigration and the southern border, but is planning to vote for him anyway. “Biden? I don’t know,” Mr. Rivera said. “It looks like we’re weak, America’s weak. We need someone stronger.”

Overall, Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump were dead even among prized independent voters, drawing 42 percent each.

But over and over, the Times/Siena poll revealed how Mr. Trump has cut into more traditional Democratic constituencies while holding his ground among Republican groups. The gender gap, for instance, is no longer benefiting Democrats. Women, who strongly favored Mr. Biden four years ago, are now equally split, while men gave Mr. Trump a nine-point edge. The poll showed Mr. Trump edging out Mr. Biden among Latinos, and Mr. Biden’s share of the Black vote is shrinking, too.

There are, of course, unpredictable X factors in a race where the Republican front-runner is facing four indictments, 91 felony counts and a criminal trial set to begin at the end of March in New York State Supreme Court.

The poll showed that 53 percent of voters currently believe Mr. Trump has committed serious federal crimes, down from 58 percent in December. But viewed another way, Mr. Trump’s current lead over Mr. Biden is built with a significant number of voters who believe he is a criminal.

The country, meanwhile, remains divided on some of the thorniest domestic and international issues.

By a narrow margin, more voters favor making it more difficult for migrants at the southern border to seek asylum (49 percent to 43 percent). Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden made dueling appearances at the border this week; illegal border crossings set record highs at the end of 2023.

As the Israel-Hamas conflict rages in its fifth month, 40 percent of voters said they sympathized more with Israel compared to 24 percent who said they sympathized more with the Palestinians. Mr. Trump was winning 70 percent of those who backed Israel primarily; Mr. Biden was winning 68 percent of those who sided with the Palestinians, even as he has faced demonstrations and a protest vote over his pro-Israel stance.

Philip Kalarickal, a 51-year-old anesthesiologist in Decatur, Ga., is a Democrat dismayed by Mr. Biden’s handling of the humanitarian fallout from the conflict in Gaza.

“Joe Biden should be doing more to ensure that the Israeli government goes about this in a way that provides safety for them but without the civilian toll,” Dr. Kalarickal said, adding that he would reluctantly back Mr. Biden this fall, given that he lives in a swing state.

“I understand that my vote or lack of vote carries a consequence, and I look at the alternative and that’s worse than the current thing,” Dr. Kalarickal said. “But I do want to register my displeasure.

"Trump-aligned lawmakers celebrate unanimous Supreme Court ballot ruling
",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-lawmakers-celebrate-unanimous-supreme-court-ballot,"Lawmakers who support former President Donald Trump celebrated the Supreme Court's unanimous decision Monday to reject the state of Colorado's attempt to keep the former president off their presidential ballot, citing the 14th Amendment. 

All nine justices, appointed by both Democratic and Republican presidents, agreed that states lack the authority ""under the Constitution to enforce Section 3 with respect to federal offices, especially the Presidency."" However, they may do so in regard to state office. 

In an exclusive statement to Fox News Digital, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said, ""I wholeheartedly agree with the Supreme Court: Voters should determine who is or isn’t on the ballot, not liberal activist judges. Today's ruling is a historic win for democracy and the American people.""

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., also applauded the court's ruling, saying in a statement, ""States engaging in the same activist, undemocratic behaviors should take notice and leave it to the American people to decide who will be president."" 

Johnson notably sent an amicus brief on the case to the Supreme Court, along with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, 135 House Republicans, and 41 Senate Republicans ahead of the decision. At the time, they argued ""the Colorado Supreme Court’s opinion tramples on the prerogatives of members of Congress.""

""We the people decide elections, not unelected radical leftists,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., added in her own statement. 

Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., also cheered the decision, writing on X: ""Grateful that SCOTUS blocked Democrats from unconstitutionally attempting to remove @realDonaldTrump from the ballot. President Trump is the choice of the American people!""


""The right decision. Glad to see the Supreme Court stand up to the extreme left’s attempts to undermine our democracy,"" said Sen. Steve Daines, R-Mont., in a post to X. 

SUPREME COURT RULES UNANIMOUSLY FOR TRUMP IN COLORADO BALLOT DISQUALIFICATION DISPUTE

House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called the decision a ""Big win for common sense and democracy!"" 

""9-0. The commies will have to find other ways to ""defend democracy"". #MAGA,"" Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., added, noting the decision's unanimity. 

Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., similarly referred to the decision as ""a victory for the rule of law,"" in a statement. 

BIDEN PREDICTS 2024 WIN IN RARE INTERVIEW, TAUNTS MEDIA, CALLS TRUMP 'LOSER'

""BREAKING: The Supreme Court defends democracy against radical leftist low-tier judges. Despite the Far Left’s never-ending political witch-hunt against Donald Trump, the Constitution and our democracy prevailed,"" wrote Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan., on X. 

Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., echoed this sentiment, slamming Colorado's move as an ""absurd political attempt to block President Donald Trump from the ballot.""


Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said he was ""glad"" to see the court choose ""the side of freedom.""

On Monday, Democrats were largely quiet on the Supreme Court's ruling. 

Social media profiles for Democratic leaders in Congress were void of any mention of the decision, even as some posted about other issues. Democratic offices further did not release statements on the matter, as their Republican colleagues did.

"Super Tuesday: What is it and why is it important?
",https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68442842,"Super Tuesday, the biggest day so far in the 2024 race for the White House, is upon us.

On 5 March, voters in 15 states and one US territory choose candidates for president.

While in a sixteenth state, we'll also get the Democrats' results.

It should offer a glimpse of Joe Biden and Donald Trump's strengths and potential weaknesses as the two bitter rivals hurtle towards a rematch in November's general election.

What is Super Tuesday and which states are voting?
It's when most states vote in the presidential primary calendar.

Nominating contests will be held in Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.
Four things to watch out for on Super Tuesday
The Republican contest will be in all of these 15 states, while the Democrats will vote in the same states except Alaska. They will hold caucuses, too, in American Samoa.

We'll also get the results of the Democratic contest in Iowa, which has been ongoing by post for several weeks.

How many delegates are up for grabs?
Based on the result of each contest, party officials known as delegates are awarded to the top candidates. A certain number of delegates is needed to formally anoint the nominee at each party's convention this summer.

About one-third of total delegates - 865 Republican and at least 1,420 Democratic - are up for grabs on Super Tuesday.

The Trump campaign has projected he will win at least 773 delegates on the day and clinch the nomination later in March. He currently has an estimated 244 delegates, while his Republican rival, Nikki Haley, has 43.

A minimum of 1,215 delegates are needed to win the Republican nomination, while 1,968 is the magic number for the Democrats.

What's at stake for Trump?
With a double-digit lead in the polls, the Republican front-runner will be hoping to finally knock his last remaining rival out of the race.

Former UN envoy Ms Haley is still standing despite only racking up a single win in a string of nominating votes so far and deep-pocketed donors closing their wallets.

Although she has no clear path to victory, Super Tuesday may be her last chance to impede Mr Trump's momentum, or expose his potential vulnerabilities heading into the general election.

In some contests to date, Mr Trump has struggled to win over college-educated suburbanites - a demographic that could ultimately thwart his dream of a White House comeback.

What about Biden?
The Democratic president is all but certain to seal his party's nomination, despite long-shot challenges from congressman Dean Phillips and self-help author Marianne Williamson.

The Biden campaign had a setback in Michigan on 27 February when 13% of voters declared themselves ""uncommitted"" amid a campaign to register a protest ballot over the president's support for Israel.

Last-minute campaigns are being cobbled together for similar protest votes in other states on Super Tuesday. California, Colorado, North Carolina, Minnesota and Vermont are among the states where such efforts are underway.

More broadly, exit poll data from across the country could reveal whether an enthusiasm gap among key blocs, including younger voters, poses a challenge for his re-election bid.

When will we know the result?
With votes happening in six time zones, the final outcome will not immediately be known.

Results will start trickling in as polls close on the east coast in the early evening.

US networks, including the BBC's US partner CBS News, are expected to begin calling states from around 20:00 ET (01:00 GMT).

Which are the other contests to watch?
Eyes will be on North Carolina, the only general election battleground voting on Tuesday. Mr Trump beat Mr Biden there in 2020 by just over a single percentage point.

Following a Supreme Court ruling, Mr Trump remains on the ballot in Colorado and Maine, despite both states trying to disqualify him on the grounds of allegedly inciting insurrection.

A potential wildcard is that several states are completely open to voters regardless of party registration. One is Virginia, where Republican voters have a relatively moderate reputation.

"Five takeaways from the US Super Tuesday primary races
",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/6/five-takeaways-from-the-us-super-tuesday-primary-races,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden continue to march towards November’s United States presidential election, securing major primary victories on Super Tuesday, one of the busiest days in the country’s election calendar.

Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley, meanwhile, got a glimmer of hope when she beat former President Trump in the small northeastern state of Vermont on Tuesday.
But it wasn’t enough to keep the former South Carolina governor and United Nations ambassador in the race. On Wednesday morning, just hours after the Super Tuesday results trickled in, Haley suspended her campaign for the White House.

Haley’s departure from the race, and President Biden’s overwhelming success on Super Tuesday – his only loss was in the US territory of American Samoa – mean a rematch of the 2020 presidential campaign is virtually guaranteed.

Super Tuesday marks the most pivotal date on the primary calendar, as the day when the most states vote. They included the two most populous, California and Texas, as well as battleground states like Minnesota and Virginia.

As a result, nearly a third of all party delegates for both Democrats and Republicans were up for grabs. While the night’s results were not enough for Trump or Biden to clinch their party’s nominations, they have both made significant strides in reaching the delegate threshold needed. A rematch of their match-up in the 2020 presidential race appears all but certain.

Here are five takeaways from the 2024 Super Tuesday results.

Haley wins big in Vermont but suspends campaign
Super Tuesday had long been the bullseye that the Haley campaign was aiming for.

“That’s as far as I’ve thought, in terms of going forward,” she said during the South Carolina primary, a race in her home state that she ultimately lost.

On Super Tuesday, she managed to squeeze out a symbolic victory in Vermont, a state in the left-leaning New England region.
But the inevitability of Trump’s nomination was beginning to discourage her donors with deep pockets. As one example, the Americans for Prosperity super PAC stepped away from her presidential bid following her defeat in South Carolina.

Haley also had only compiled 89 delegates, far behind Trump’s total of 995, and the 1,215 overall delegates needed to secure the party’s nomination.

“I congratulate him [Trump] and wish him well. I wish anyone well who would be America’s president,” Haley said on Wednesday morning as she announced she was suspending her campaign. “Our country is too precious to let our differences divide us.”

Michael Fauntroy, a political science professor at George Mason University, told Al Jazeera that Haley’s Super Tuesday performance might be less significant as a reflection of her success – and more indicative of the weaknesses Trump faces going into the general election.

“If you look at many of the closely contested swing states that we’ve seen so far, including some tonight, there are roughly 20 percent to maybe even a third of Republican voters in those states who are voting for Nikki Haley,” he said.

“And in a closely contested state like Michigan or Wisconsin, perhaps even North Carolina, if those voters stay home in November or just can’t bring themselves to vote for former President Trump, then former President Trump cannot win those states. And if he can’t win those states, he can’t win the election.”

Protest vote against Biden spreads
Super Tuesday has likewise forced Biden to confront the vulnerabilities in his campaign. A protest campaign that started largely in Michigan continued to exert influence over the day’s races.

In last month’s Michigan primary, grassroots movements called on voters to choose the “uncommitted” option on their ballot instead of Biden, as a rebuke to his stance on Israel’s war in Gaza.

Biden has long touted his “rock-solid” support for Israel, even as its military offensive in the Palestinian enclave elicited concerns about the risk of genocide and famine. More than 30,000 Palestinians have died in Israel’s military campaign so far.

The “uncommitted” movement ultimately pulled an estimated 101,000 votes in the Michigan primary – or approximately 13 percent of the total ballots cast.

The push to vote “uncommitted” remained strong on Super Tuesday. That was particularly apparent in Minnesota, a key swing state in the Midwest. Early results showed that “uncommitted” was in second place in that state’s Democratic primary, with nearly 20 percent of the vote.

That could spell trouble for Biden in the general elections, as he faces drooping poll numbers – and a tight race against his likely opponent Trump.

Senate race in California deals blow to progressives
One of the biggest down-ballot primaries was the race to replace the late Senator Dianne Feinstein, who passed away last year after more than 30 years representing California.

To decide which two candidates would proceed to the general elections in November, California held a “jungle primary”, where Senate hopefuls from any party could participate. It proved to be a fatal contest for the race’s two most prominent progressives, Representatives Barbara Lee and Katie Porter.

Both women had decided against running for re-election to the House of Representatives in order to compete in the Senate race. It was a high-stakes gamble. The two representatives had developed national profiles, Lee as an antiwar figure and Porter as a champion against corporate overreach.

Their fellow US representative, centrist Democrat Adam Schiff, handily emerged as the frontrunner on Super Tuesday, despite criticism for his pro-Israel stance amid the Gaza war. But Lee and Porter were ultimately edged out by a Republican with no previous political experience: former baseball player Steve Garvey.

The result has left their political careers in question – and Porter’s congressional district vulnerable to being flipped. Control of both the House and the Senate are up in the air this November.

A referendum on Trump’s grip over Republicans
Other hotly anticipated races revolved around gauging just how strong Trump’s sway over the Republican Party is.

In the Republican stronghold of Texas, for instance, one state-level race showed how fierce the internal power struggle has become.

Two-term state Representative Dade Phelan had gained a relatively high profile as Texas’s Speaker of the House – a powerful figure in the state’s politics – and this year, he was up for re-election.

But he had spurred the ire of the far-right flank of his party by overseeing the recent impeachment of Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican provocateur known for challenging the Biden administration in the courts. Paxton had also previously petitioned the US Supreme Court to reject Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election, in support of Trump’s false claims of voter fraud.

In the Super Tuesday primary, Phelan came to represent the more establishment branch of the Republican Party, while his adversary David Covey enjoyed the endorsements of Trump and Paxton.

The Republican race was so close, however, that it is set to go to a runoff in May, teeing up another battle for the soul of the party.

Biden and Trump look ahead to November showdown
Despite a wobble for Biden in American Samoa and a loss for Trump in Vermont, the two frontrunners seem destined for a rematch in November’s general elections.

They each offered a glimpse of their campaign strategies moving forward, with comments released amid the Super Tuesday results.

Trump took the stage in person at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, greeting a ballroom full of supporters for an election night watch party.

As he spoke, though, Trump revisited familiar themes: the United States was in decline, he said, and only he could reverse the slide. He made no mentions of Haley, his only major Republican rival left standing, focusing instead on Biden.

“He’s the worst president in the history of our country,” Trump said of Biden, blaming the Democratic incumbent for inflation, the immigration crisis at the US-Mexico border and conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. “We’ve watched our country take a great beating over the last three years.”

Biden likewise returned to his familiar playbook, warning that Trump represented an existential threat to US democracy.

“My message to the country is this: Every generation of Americans will face a moment when it has to defend democracy,” Biden said in a Super Tuesday statement. A centrist, he framed himself as the candidate of unity, offering a preview of his appeal to voters in November.

"Trump dominating, Haley winning her first state round out top moments from Super Tuesday",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/haley-first-statewide-victory-surprise-loss-biden-top-moments-super-tuesday,"Former President Donald Trump and President Biden continued marching toward their respective parties' presidential nominations largely unhindered this Super Tuesday as both swept nearly every contest on the largest primary night of 2024.

Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, hoped to find some light at the end of the tunnel after staking her candidacy on the 15 states casting ballots, while Biden's top challengers looked for any glimmer of success after making their case against the president's age and ability to take on Trump in a general election rematch.

From Haley securing her first statewide victory to Biden suffering a shocking defeat to an obscure businessman, here are the top moments from what many thought would be an uneventful Super Tuesday:

SUPER TUESDAY BOOSTING TRUMP CLOSER TO CLINCHING GOP NOMINATION AS HALEY MAKES POSSIBLE LAST STAND

1. Trump triumphs, though Haley wins first statewide contest in Northeast nail-biter
Trump won nearly every Super Tuesday state as he got closer to clinching the GOP nomination for president. Still, after winning her first contest in the race for the Republican nomination in the Washington, D.C. primary over the weekend, Haley secured her first statewide victory by narrowly edging Trump in Vermont.

The Fox News Decision Desk called the race after both candidates alternated taking the lead as the votes were counted over a period of a few hours following polls closing.

Haley was widely expected to do well in Vermont, one of the few states that held an open primary on Tuesday night where both Republicans and Democrats could vote.

Leading up to the primary, Haley held an event in the state featuring Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott, a vocal critic of Trump, who had previously endorsed her White House bid.

Vermont will award 17 delegates in the primary. If Haley hits 50%, she will be awarded all the state's delegates. If not, the delegates will be divided up between her and Trump.

Vermont was a staunch red state up until the election of Democrat President Bill Clinton in 1992. Former President George H.W. Bush defeated former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis in the state four years prior. Democrats have easily won the state every election since.

2. Biden suffers first 2024 loss to little known challenger
Biden lost his first contest in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination to a largely unknown candidate in the U.S. territory of American Samoa, while his better-known challengers, author Marianne Williamson and Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, failed to gain much traction with voters.

The Fox News Decision Desk projected that Jason Palmer, a self-described entrepreneur and investor, would win American Samoa's caucuses, taking four delegates to Biden's two.

On his campaign website, Palmer describes himself as a 52-year-old resident of Baltimore, Maryland, with leadership and executive experience working for companies like Microsoft and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, among others.

According to Palmer, he also has 25 years of small business experience in addition to his executive-level experience.

A Mar. 1 press release from Palmer's campaign says the businessman will appear on the ballot in 16 states and territories, and touts him as being the youngest Democrat candidate for president.

Palmer reacted to his victory in American Samoa in a post on X, saying, ""Honored to announce my victory in the American Samoa presidential primary. Thank you to the incredible community for your support. This win is a testament to the power of our voices. Together, we can rebuild the American Dream and shape a brighter future for all.""

The Biden campaign downplayed the loss by pointing to what it said was the likelihood that less than 500 total votes were cast in the contest.

As a territory, American Samoa does not get a vote in the general presidential election, and is only permitted to send delegates to the convention during the primary season. 

3. Haley remains vague on her campaign's future
Haley did not make any public address on Tuesday after most of the races had been called for Trump except for her lone victory in Vermont's primary. It's unclear if she intends to remain in the race, but a statement released by her campaign after most of the races had been called claimed a ""large block"" of Republican voters still had ""deep concerns"" about Trump.

""We’re honored to have received the support of millions of Americans across the country today, including in Vermont where Nikki became the first Republican woman to win two presidential primary contests,"" campaign spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas said.

""Unity is not achieved by simply claiming 'we’re united.' Today, in state after state, there remains a large block of Republican primary voters who are expressing deep concerns about Donald Trump. That is not the unity our party needs for success. Addressing those voters’ concerns will make the Republican Party and America better,"" she added.

After losses in Iowa and New Hampshire earlier in the year, Haley invested heavily in her home state of South Carolina, only to lose to Trump by a massive 20-point margin.

She then vowed to stay in the race and appeared to be staking her campaign on the results of Super Tuesday.

4. Concern grows over Trump's ability to win over Haley supporters
Although Haley came out on top in just one contest on Tuesday, recent polls suggest large portions of voters supporting her say they were motivated by their opposition to Trump, and that they might not shift their support to him as the Republican nominee in November.

That doesn't mean those would automatically show up to support Biden, but, as Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Karl Rove said amid Tuesday's results being tallied, ""Team Trump ought to be concerned about unifying the Republican Party.""

Rove, who made the comments while appearing on Fox News' Super Tuesday coverage, pointed to Haley winning a significant share of the vote in Vermont, Virginia, Massachusetts, Maine, and North Carolina.

""There's still some work to be done to unify the Republican Party, and that's going to depend a lot on [Trump's] tone tonight, and whether or not he stops doing things like calling [Haley] ‘birdbrain,' and threatening that if you give money to her campaign you're going to be permanently banned,"" he said.

Trump spoke for around 20 minutes not long after Rove's comments, but didn't once mention Haley. He has consistently condemned Republicans not considered part of the ""MAGA"" wing of the party.

"The general election is here and it’s Trump vs. Biden
",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/06/politics/trump-biden-general-election-analysis/index.html,"Donald Trump left the White House a loser.

But now, only one man – President Joe Biden – can thwart his predecessor’s return in what would be the most astonishing political comeback in history.

Only three years after Trump slunk out of Washington in disgrace – days after the mob he told to “fight like hell” ransacked the US Capitol – and even as he faces four looming criminal trials, he has already engineered a bounce back for the ages in the Republican primary.

Trump went on a roll on Super Tuesday. He won the Virginia, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Maine, Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts and California Republican primaries. Every big state called in his favor brought the ex-president ever closer to a general election campaign against his 2020 vanquisher that polls show he’s got at least an even chance of winning.

Takeaways from Super Tuesday
To adapt the title of one of his books, it’s the “Art of the Comeback.”

As the results rolled in, Biden and Trump took aim at each other, setting the stage for what is sure to be a bitter clash in November certain to cleave even deeper national political divides.

“We’re going to win this election because we have no choice,” Trump said at his Mar-a-Lago resort as he savored his sweetest election night since he beat Hillary Clinton in 2016. He spoke against a backdrop of American flags that conjured the theatrics of the presidency that he hopes to regain.

Trump evoked his one-term in the White House as if it was some kind of economic golden age and added: “If we lose this election, we’re not going to have a country.” That last line was a chilling echo of his searing speech in Washington on January 6, 2021, before the most brazen attack on democracy in modern American history.

Biden reacted to Trump’s Super Tuesday victories by immediately cranking up his general election attack on the former president – previewing an argument that will be at the center of his own campaign for a second term.

As he seeks to paper over his vulnerabilities on issues like immigration and the economy, Biden is warning that Americans face an existential dilemma.

“Tonight’s results leave the American people with a clear choice: Are we going to keep moving forward or will we allow Donald Trump to drag us backwards into the chaos, division, and darkness that defined his term in office?” Biden said in a statement.

“If Donald Trump returns to the White House, all of this progress is at risk. He is driven by grievance and grift, focused on his own revenge and retribution, not the American people. He is determined to destroy our democracy … and he’ll do or say anything to put himself in power.”

Victory after victory for Trump
Officially, the ex-president is still short of the delegates needed to be the presumptive GOP nominee. He’ll probably push past the magic number of 1,215 next week. His wins Tuesday obliterated any hypothetical path to the nomination for his last GOP rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who announced Wednesday that she is exiting the race. Haley withheld an endorsement of Trump, calling on him instead to earn the support of voters who backed her.

His cruise through this year’s primaries has underscored his utter dominance of the Republican Party. It has highlighted his imperviousness to scandals and shame that doom mortal political careers – at least among activist voters who decide the GOP nomination.

Hundreds of thousands of Republican voters can’t sign up fast enough for Trump’s vows of “retribution” against his enemies as he paints a dark picture of a nation paralyzed by crime, invaded by migrants and slipping toward World War III.

Democrats will enter a rematch with Trump deeply concerned, given Biden’s rock-bottom approval ratings and increasing public doubts over whether the oldest president in history is fit to serve a second term that would end when he is 86. Many voters still feel deeply insecure despite the robust economic recovery that has racked up record job numbers and is outpacing other industrialized states. Still, elevated grocery prices and high rents are a reminder that many are waiting for the return to pre-pandemic normality that Biden promised in 2020.

Yet amid Trump’s dominance, there were sufficient data points to suggest that he’s still beset by some liabilities that resulted in his ejection from the White House four years ago. His greatest weakness still lurks – his character and extremism alienate more moderate, suburban voters. The fate of the 2024 election may well rest on whether GOP primary voters who picked Haley in such areas overcome their antipathy and vote for Trump in November.

The Biden campaign has long said that the president’s polling numbers are being depressed by the fact that he’s not yet being judged as the alternative to Trump. The time for that excuse is going to fast run out now that the shape of the 2024 general election is clear.

“Tonight the campaign started up,” Biden’s National Campaign Co-Chair Mitch Landrieu told CNN on Tuesday night. “Until now, people didn’t think it was going to be Biden versus Trump, but here we are and we’re ready to go,” he said.

A comeback for the ages
Other politicians have seen their careers in tatters and come back to triumph. Richard Nixon lost the 1960 presidential election and then a California gubernatorial race two years later. He vowed people wouldn’t have the chance to kick him around anymore as political retirement beckoned. But in 1968, he was back and won the presidency.

Bill Clinton was mired in personal scandals in the 1992 presidential primary race but became the “comeback kid” in New Hampshire on the way to the White House. And Biden cemented his grip on the Democratic nomination four years ago on Super Tuesday after a disastrous tramp through early state contests that he only turned around with a victory over Bernie Sanders in South Carolina several weeks before.

But Trump faced headwinds like no candidate before him. They include two impeachments, 91 criminal charges, four criminal trials, a devastating $450 million civil court judgment pending and a legacy scarred by chaotic leadership in a pandemic. But none of it stopped his surge toward the GOP nomination. Indeed his manipulation of his indictments – including for his attempt to steal the 2020 election – energized supporters as he branded himself a persecuted dissident.

One-term presidents are almost always done after being drummed out of the White House. But Trump’s surge to the GOP nomination means he has a chance to emulate the ultimate comeback in American politics – the victory of former President Grover Cleveland over sitting President Benjamin Harrison. In 1892, Cleveland became the only commander in chief (so far) to win a non-consecutive second term.

One reason why Trump didn’t come across as a loser to his supporters was that he convinced grassroots GOP voters that he didn’t actually lose the 2020 election. Even though he did. Tuesday’s early exit polls showed that about 6 in 10 GOP primary voters in North Carolina believe that Biden’s victory over Trump four years ago was illegitimate. Roughly half of Republican primary voters in Virginia thought the same, mirroring sentiments of Trump supporters all around the country that reflect the former president’s unmatched capacity to create an alternative reality.

The bond between Trump and his most faithful supporters was never severed. Their unstinting affection for their champion became clear as soon as long lines of supporters lined up all day, shivering in their “Make America Great Again” souvenir regalia, outside his early events in frigid Iowa and New Hampshire in January.

Trump’s march toward the GOP nomination is even more striking given how far his political star had dimmed. His intervention in the 2022 midterms was mainly disastrous as he strong-armed candidates in swing states that signed up to his election denialism – often at the price of seats his party might have won. Democratic control of the Senate and the tiny House GOP majority that fell short of red wave expectations were widely blamed on his botched strategizing. When people started filing out of Trump’s early presidential announcement speech at Mar-a-Lago late that year, it appeared that the former president was a busted political force and that 2024 would be a race too far.

The key to Trump’s lasting resurgence may turn out to lie in an extraordinary moment inside a notorious jail in Atlanta last in August. Trump became the first former president to suffer the indignity of providing a mug shot, as he surrendered following his fourth criminal indictment.

But Inmate No. P01135809 did not cower in shame. He weaponized his misfortune, claiming he was being persecuted by the administration of his successor to ensure he couldn’t mount a political comeback. Trump’s fundraising soared. His Republican true believers embraced his narrative of political martyrdom. And Trump’s potential 2024 GOP rivals soon found their running room clipped.

Former Vice President Mike Pence, who refused to aid Trump’s Constitution-busting on January 6, quickly worked out there’s no room in the modern GOP for standing up for democracy. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis had a theory that what Republican voters wanted after the mayhem of the Trump years was the same kind of “Make America Great Again” extremism minus the chaos. Wrong again. And the campaign of the last-standing Haley will mostly be remembered for disproving the long-held conventional wisdom that once the ex-president got in a one-on-one race with an opponent, the anti-Trump forces in the party would soon overwhelm him.

Biden tackles inflation by targeting hidden fees. Will voters notice?,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/biden-tackles-inflation-targeting-hidden-fees-voters-notice/story?id=107803193,"Enthusiasm about the economy has soared but voters still bemoan inflation.
Enthusiasm about the U.S. economy has soared in recent months but polls indicate most consumers still bemoan inflation. More than 60% of adults say recent price increases have caused financial hardship for their family, a Gallup poll in January found.

Prices, in turn, have taken on outsized importance on the brink of a presidential election that may hinge on bread-and-butter concerns.

In recent months, the White House has announced a raft of measures aimed at lowering onerous fees faced by consumers when they miss a credit card payment, overdraft a bank account or book a hotel room.

The initiatives tackle costs borne by a large swathe of Americans, delivering potential savings while signaling the Biden administration's desire to protect consumers from corporate practices that it deems predatory, some experts told ABC News.

However, they added, the message may not register with most Americans, since the hidden fees often remain out of sight, leaving them less influential than expenses like gas and grocery prices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finalized a rule on Tuesday that will cut the typical credit card late fee to $8 from $32, saving U.S. consumers an estimated $10 billion per year. Late credit card payments have reached their highest level since 2011, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation found in a report released on Thursday.

The White House policy came roughly two months after the CFPB introduced a rule that would slash the fee charged by banks when customers overdraft an account.

Since last year, the White House has undertaken a separate campaign to reduce ""junk fees,"" such as hidden costs added toward the end of a purchase involving concert or airline tickets.

""Fighting hidden junk fees is part of the President's broader agenda to lower costs for Americans. The President thinks about these issues from the perspective of families sitting around the kitchen table working through their bills and balancing their budgets every month. While these fees might not mean much for the wealthy, they add up for middle-class families,"" Jon Donenberg, deputy director at the National Economic Council, a Biden administration group that advises the president, told ABC News.

In a statement, the Biden campaign said it will take efforts to ensure that voters are made aware of the measures aimed at tackling fees.

""This is exactly what campaigns are built for -- to build awareness around the President's accomplishments and agenda, and cement the choice for voters for November,"" Seth Schuster, a rapid response spokesperson for the campaign, told ABC News. ""Voters are just beginning to tune into the election and I fully expect that as the campaign uses its massive war chest to communicate this choice to voters, it will bode well for President Biden the only day polls really matter: election day.""

Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog at nonprofit advocacy U.S. PIRG Education Fund, praised the measures as a much-needed assault on unfair costs, especially when price increases burden many households.

""It's important to have transparency and fairness no matter how good or how bad the economy is – no matter how high inflation is,"" Murray told ABC News. ""But at a time when a lot of folks are dealing with inflation and high food prices, then every dollar does count.""

The rules may not only lower costs for some Americans but also send a message that the Biden administration understands the challenges posed by high costs and aims to address them, Jon Krosnick, a professor of political science at Stanford University who studies how prices affect perceptions of the economy, told ABC News.

The goodwill toward Biden could extend well beyond those directly impacted, Krosnick said, since decades of research show that voters approach economic news through a wide lens that considers the implications for society at large.

""People ask 'Is this good for the country as a whole?' rather than 'Is this good for me personally?'"" Krosnick said.

However, many voters may not become aware of the initiatives in the first place because the measures lower hidden fees that consumers often lose sight of anyway, some experts said. ""Perceived price changes in very salient cases -- such as groceries and other everyday goods -- are a very crucial determinant of household beliefs about the economy,"" Francesco D'Acunto, a Georgetown University finance professor who studies how people understand economic news, told ABC News.

The Biden administration, by contrast, is ""targeting potentially important costs households face but ones that are less salient. So it would probably be less effective,"" D'Acunto added.

Utpal Dholakia, a marketing professor at Rice University, echoed the point, noting that many of the fees occur less frequently than common household expenses.

""Most of us don't stay in hotels 20 nights a month -- most of us stay occasionally,"" Dholakia said. ""It's not something that most people are concerned about on a day-to-day basis.""

For those who do hear about the initiatives, Dholakia added, the response may be determined by partisan affiliation instead of financial relief.

""To the extent that you're politically engaged and a Democrat, you'll obviously look at these actions in a positive light,"" Dholakia said. ""If you're a Republican or independent, your reaction will be more muted.""

Polling data shows broad support across both major parties for the efforts to address fees, a White House official said. A survey in December from Data for Progress, a left-leaning polling firm, found that a Biden proposal to address junk fees was backed by 81% of Democrats and 77% of Republicans. The U.S. economy performs well on just about every measure of economic health. Inflation is falling, job growth is surging, and gross domestic product is proving much more resilient than expected in the aftermath of near-historic interest rate hikes.

Attitudes about the economy have improved in recent months, data shows. Consumer sentiment inched lower in February but preserved much of the large gains achieved in previous months. The index, however, remains well below pre-pandemic levels, a University of Michigan survey found.

Despite making up a small share of consumers' overall expenses, the fees tackled by Biden could draw more attention than some might expect, Amit Bhattacharjee, a marketing professor at the University of Colorado, told ABC News.

State of the Union: What the world made of Biden's big speech,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-68510250,"Foreign policy figured highly in Joe Biden's annual address to Congress, which highlighted US involvement in conflicts around the world. So how was his speech received in those places?

It was notable that the president chose to begin his State of the Union by discussing Ukraine. He later went on to spend a few minutes on the Israel-Hamas war and finished by talking about ""standing up"" to China.

We asked three BBC correspondents to analyse his comments in each area.

Nazi comparison will annoy Putin
A year before the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Biden agreed with an interviewer that Vladimir Putin was a ""killer"", enraging the Kremlin. Three years later, Mr Biden has now compared him to Adolf Hitler.

In his State of the Union address, he referred to Hitler being ""on the march"" in 1941 in Europe and then said that the Russian leader was ""on the march"" himself, warning that Russian aggression would not stop at Ukraine.

Biden draws election battle lines in fiery speech
'We know what's coming': East Ukraine braces for Russian advance
His message to President Putin, he said in his speech, was simple. ""We will not bow down.""

The Russian leader has claimed, falsely, that his invasion of Ukraine is aimed at ""de-Nazifying"" Russia's neighbour and he has elevated the Soviet Union's defeat of Hitler in World War II to near-cult status. So Moscow won't like this comparison at all.

But Mr Biden wasn't addressing Russia alone. He stressed the urgent need for the US to continue supporting Ukraine as it battles to defend itself and he called on Congress to unblock the bill that would release the funding Kyiv needs.

I've heard politicians and analysts in Ukraine describe losing US financial backing as ""catastrophic"". The delay is already damaging, forcing soldiers to ration ammunition on the frontlines.

As Moscow smarts at the comparison with Nazi Germany, Ukraine will welcome a State of the Union speech that opened with a rallying cry for democracy and support for Kyiv. President Biden said the US wouldn't ""walk away"".

Such words are important and appreciated. But similar calls have been uttered before and all the time Ukraine is losing more territory and more soldiers.

Unease in China as Biden talks tough
By Laura Bicker, China correspondent

It's hard to know which candidate China would prefer as it watches the discord on display in Washington during the State of the Union.

The contrast with its own rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, is stark. Nearly 3,000 delegates are meeting in Beijing this week in the Great Hall of the People where speeches are watched with quiet nods, a reverent hush and unwavering approval from the Communist Party elite.

There will be a level of unease from China's business sector that President Biden sees the need to show how tough he will be on Beijing. He said he wanted ""competition - not conflict"" with China, but business leaders may ask what form that competition will take.



Who does China’s Communist Party want - Trump or Biden?
He has already expanded sanctions against China on a range of issues, from human rights abuses to its relations with Russia. Relations are also strained over China's behaviour in disputed areas of the South China Sea, its military intimidation of Taiwan and growing technological competition.

Beijing will not see Mr Biden's competitor as a more promising prospect. While president, Donald Trump started a trade war with China and recently threatened to impose a 60% tariff on Chinese goods if he wins in November.

But Beijing might like the idea of another Trump presidency. The Biden administration has built an alliance to counter the might of China and he has been clear that the US would defend Taiwan if China tried to take the self-governing island by force.

The Taiwan that China wants is vanishing
In contrast, Mr Trump has refused to say he would help Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory.

China can exploit these differences in Washington and use them to appear as a safer, long-term diplomatic bet for countries around the world as the two compete for global influence.

Biden's rebuke picked up in Israeli media
By Yolande Knell, Middle East correspondent

President Biden called events of the past five months ""gut-wrenching"" in his address.

While he blamed Hamas for starting the Gaza war, he stressed the high civilian death toll among Palestinians and had a sharp message for Israel about the need to allow basic supplies to reach the besieged territory, amid UN warnings of mass starvation.

Aid, he said, ""cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip. Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority."" This rebuke featured prominently in the Israeli media on Friday morning.

Driven by domestic politics in an election year - the need to show stronger American action - as well as deep humanitarian need, Mr Biden announced a plan for a new floating pier off Gaza to bring in food and basic supplies on ships via Cyprus.

In many ways, this ambitious idea - which the president was careful to say would not involve US military boots on the ground - is a measure of frustration with a key ally.

Israel officially welcomed the plan. It has stopped aid from entering via its own Mediterranean container port, Ashdod, 35km from northern Gaza, and also resisted opening more border crossings.",3/8/2024,Sarah Rainsford,BBC News,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Hitler""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""BBC""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Kyiv""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Vladimir Putin""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Adolf Hitler""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""US""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Moscow""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Europe""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Putin""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Russia""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Ukraine""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""World War II""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Security Council""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Kremlin""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""State of the Union""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Soviet Union""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""China""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Congress""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""President Biden""}]",0.55
Why it will be tough for Biden to defeat Trump,https://abcnews.go.com/Business/biden-tackles-inflation-targeting-hidden-fees-voters-notice/story?id=107803193,"The 2024 presidential general election is here, for all intents and purposes. Joe Biden and Donald Trump are set to face off in the first presidential rematch since 1956. It’s also the first rematch between a current and a former president since 1892.

But unlike in 2020 when he was favored over Trump for the entirety of the campaign, Biden faces a rougher road this time around. Indeed, he has no better than a 50-50 shot for reelection, and fans of the current president should be aware that Trump has a real chance at retaking the White House.

Just look at the polls that were released in the past week. Surveys from The New York Times/Siena College, CBS News/YouGov, Fox News and The Wall Street Journal all gave Trump a higher percentage of the vote than Biden by margins ranging from 2 to 4 points. (KFF had Biden scoring 3 points higher than Trump.)

All those results were officially within the margin of error, but put together they paint a picture of a troubled incumbent.

It’s not just that Biden is in worse shape against his general election opponent than almost any incumbent in the past 75 years (save Trump in 2020). It’s that a lead of any margin for Trump was unheard of during the 2020 campaign – not a single poll that met CNN’s standards for publication showed Trump leading Biden nationally.

And in that 2020 race, the states that put Biden over the top in the Electoral College (Arizona, Georgia and Wisconsin) were each decided by less than a point. He had very little margin for error. The state of polling today looks worse for Biden. I’ve previously pointed out that the president looks to be in a considerably worse position in Sun Belt battleground states today than four years ago.

He’s trailing by 5 points or more in the most recent polling from Arizona, Georgia and Nevada. No Democratic presidential candidate has lost Nevada since 2004.

If Biden loses all of those states, he can still win if he carries every other contest he did in 2020 — that would help him finish 270-268 in electoral votes.

The problem for Biden is that he’s behind in Michigan. The average of polls over the past six months that meet CNN’s standards for publication has him down 4 points. In other words, the polls show Trump ahead, however narrowly, in enough states right now to win the Electoral College and the presidency.

The election, though, isn’t being held today or tomorrow. It’s being held in about eight months.

But if I were Biden, it’s not so much the “horse race” polling that would bother me. It’s what lies underneath the hood.

Americans say the top problems facing the country are either related to the economy or immigration. Trump is considerably more trusted than Biden on both issues. It’s possible that if consumer sentiment continues to improve or border crossings decline, Biden could pick up steam against Trump.

Then again, I’m not so sure. Biden is the least popular elected incumbent at this point in his reelection bid since World War II. His approval rating is hovering at or just below 40%. The two most recent incumbents with similarly low approval ratings around this point in their presidencies (Trump and George H.W. Bush in 1992) both lost in November.

A lot of Democrats like to argue that you can’t just look at Biden’s approval ratings. His opponent is unpopular too, with unfavorable ratings above his favorable ratings.

It’s a fair point, but numerous polls (including the most recent ones from Fox News, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal) have Trump’s favorable ratings a few points higher than Biden’s. Again, this is very different from what we were seeing in 2020.

This means that it isn’t enough for Biden merely to win voters who dislike both men. He has to win them by a substantial margin to make up for his popularity deficit.

With eight months to go, Biden could certainly make up the gap. But unlike in most campaigns, both major-party candidates are already well defined. Less than 5% of voters aren’t able to register an opinion on Biden or Trump. For more people to turn against Trump, Biden’s best hope may lie with the four criminal indictments against the former president. Putting aside the fact that the start dates for most of those trials are iffy, except for the New York hush money case, it’s not clear how much of a difference it would make were Trump to be found guilty in any of those cases.

A majority of likely voters (53%) said they already thought Trump had committed a serious federal crime, according to the New York Times polling. The same poll showed Trump up 4 points among likely voters.

Trump was ahead in this survey because 18% of his supporters said he had committed a serious federal crime and were still backing him. Such a statistic should be worrying to Biden supporters because if some voters think Trump committed a serious federal crime but are still willing to vote for him, what could possibly get them to change their minds?

By the same token, the Times polling found that 72% of likely voters said Biden’s age made him too old to be an effective president (compared with the comparatively smaller 53% who said Trump had committed a serious federal crime). This gap could be one of the biggest reasons Biden is having issues against Trump.

Perhaps the big question over the next eight months is whether Trump’s weaknesses will start to outweigh Biden’s. If they do, it’s probably the president’s best chance at earning another term.",3/9/2024,Harry Enten,CNN,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""general election""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Arizona""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Wisconsin""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020 campaign""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""YouGov""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""presidential rematch""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Fox News""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""CBS News""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""White House""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""KFF""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""The Wall Street Journal""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""The New York Times/Siena College""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Electoral College""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Nevada""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Sun Belt""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""CNN""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democratic""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024 presidential general election""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}]",0.53
Joe Biden's reelection campaign brought in record $10 million in the 24 hours after his State of the Union address,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/joe-bidens-reelection-campaign-brought-32317588,"The funds have already been invested in a $30 million advertisement used across swing states to promote Biden’s campaign as the election year steps up a notch

President Joe Biden raised a single-day record $10 million (£7.7 million) within 24 hours of his State of the Union Speech on Thursday.
Making around a quarter of all funds raised for the Democrats in a month, in one day, the Biden-Harris campaign made good on their goal of ramping up funds ahead of the upcoming election.

Biden's campaign brought in a total $42 million overall in the month of January meaning there was a total $56 million in the bank by the end of the month.

As Super Tuesday saw Trump sweep the polls in the Republican primaries, it is now near guaranteed that Trump and Biden will go head to head once again in the upcoming elections.

On Thursday Biden went to Capitol Hill for his last State of the Union address before Congress of his first term. According to a senior advisor, following his speech, the next day 113,000 contributions were made to Biden's campaign funds as part of a wider number of 116,000 donations over the 24 hours.

Former President Donald Trump’s political operation amassed about $130 million in the final months of last year but after spending heavily, headed into 2024 with more than $42 million to start the election year.

Biden received little recognition from Republican lawmakers but his remarks were popular with Democrats. The funds have already been invested in a $30 million advertisement used across swing states to promote Biden’s campaign. Biden also followed his speech by visiting more swing states to speak, making trips to both Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Atlanta, Georgia over the weekend.
In the clip, Biden acknowledges his age, a factor that has come under fire from the Republicans, and emphasises this life experience makes him a good presidential candidate. Similarly at the State of the Union address, he claimed at 81 years of age he is able to “get things done.”

After Super Tuesday, Trump became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee especially after his remaining competitor, Nikki Haley, suspended her campaign on Wednesday.
Biden’s speech was briefly interrupted by the father of a Marine killed in Afghanistan. Steve Nikoui, who has now been arrested, shouted at the President as he said: ""America is safer today than when I took office"". Mr Nikoui then interrupted Biden's speech from the chamber's balcony to yell: “Abbey Gate! Second Battalion, First Marines!""
Capitol Police then escorted the 51-year-old out of the chamber at around 10.15pm and took him into custody. He was charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding Congress, a misdemeanour that usually sees the offender released after paying a $50 fine.

Biden says he regrets using term ‘illegal’ to describe Laken Riley murder suspect,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/10/biden-trump-laken-riley-immigration,"Trump, meanwhile, blasted Biden’s immigration policies and blamed president for Riley’s death at dueling Georgia rally. Joe Biden said Saturday that he regretted using the term “illegal” during his State of the Union address to describe the suspected killer of University of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley.

Meanwhile, the Democratic president’s all-but-certain 2024 Republican rival, Donald Trump, blasted Biden’s immigration policies and blamed them for Riley’s death while at a rally attended by her family and friends. He contrasted his rhetoric with Biden’s, remarking: “I say he was an illegal alien. He was an illegal immigrant. He was an illegal migrant.”

He also accused Biden of having “no intention of stopping the deadly invasion that stole precious Laken’s beautiful American life”.

Yet Biden earlier this year bucked activists within his party by agreeing to make changes to US immigration law that would have limited some migration. The deal that emerged would have overhauled the asylum system to provide faster and tougher enforcement, as well as given presidents new powers to immediately expel migrants if authorities become overwhelmed. It also would have added $20bn in funding, a huge influx of cash.

The changes became part of a short-lived bipartisan compromise that Republican lawmakers quickly killed after Trump made his opposition known.

After the deal’s collapse, Biden has been considering taking executive action to try to curtail migration. But he’s expressed frustration that his lawyers have yet to devise options that they believe can pass muster with federal courts. Biden, instead, has insisted that Congress take up the measure again, trying to flip the script on Republicans and arguing they are more interested in being able to talk about the issue in an election year than taking action to fix it.

Biden hits out at Trump in Georgia rally: ‘He’s been sucking up to dictators all over the world’

Biden expressed remorse after facing frustration from some in his party for the use of the term to describe people who arrived or are living in the US illegally.

“I shouldn’t have used illegal – it’s undocumented,” Biden said in an interview with MSNBC’s Jonathan Capehart taped in Atlanta, where he was meeting with small business owners and holding a campaign rally.

Trump, campaigning in Rome, Georgia, at the same time, assailed Biden for the comments.

“Joe Biden went on television and apologized for calling Laken’s murderer an illegal,” he said to loud jeers and boos. “Biden should be apologizing for apologizing to this killer.”

The back-and-forth underscored how Riley’s murder has become a flashpoint in the 2024 campaign and a rallying cry for Republicans who have seized on frustrations over the Biden administration’s handling of the US-Mexico border during a record surge of migrants entering the country. A person from Venezuela who entered the US illegally has been arrested and charged with her murder.

The former president was joined at his rally by Riley’s parents, her sister and friends and met with them before he took the stage.

In a speech that lasted nearly two hours, Trump hammered Biden on the border and for mispronouncing Riley’s name during his State of the Union address this past week.

Trump alleged that Riley “would be alive today if Joe Biden had not willfully and maliciously eviscerated the borders of the United States and set loose thousands and thousands of dangerous criminals into our country”.

"Biden and Trump go on the hunt for the independent voter, an important goal",https://english.elpais.com/usa/elections/2024-03-10/biden-and-trump-go-on-the-hunt-for-the-independent-voter-an-important-goal.html,"They identify as neither Republicans nor Democrats and represent almost half of the electorate, a percentage that is growing steadily; in the November elections, they will be more crucial than ever. The withdrawal of Republican candidate Nikki Haley after the poor results of Super Tuesday marked the beginning of the independent voter hunting season, which will be fiercer than ever in the U.S. elections next November. Despite her refusal to endorse him, Haley also cleared the way for Donald Trump to be his party’s nominee in the race for the White House, which will lead him to face Joe Biden one more time.

After Haley’s resignation, both politicians threw themselves into the courtship of Haley’s supporters. It is a heterogeneous group, a mix of independents, old-fashioned Republicans and never Trumpers, the former president’s most intimate enemies. There are also moderate and college-educated voters, as well as suburbanites, which in this country is more a state of mind than a geographic location. Trump invited everyone to “join the greatest movement in the history of this country,” while Biden reminded them that there was room for them in his campaign. For Haley, her supporters helped her win two primaries (the District of Columbia and Vermont). In interviews with a dozen of them in those of South Carolina, they seemed united by the fear of a second round of Trump and by the desire for American conservatism to turn the page on the tycoon, who this Friday secured total control of the Republican National Committee (RNC), the governing body of the formation, by placing Michael Whatley, a man of his confidence, at the head (the operation was completed with the appointment of his daughter-in-law Lara Trump as co-chair). Now that he is the party’s candidate, the RNC will be able to contribute to the financing of his campaign. When asked what they planned to do without Haley, most of his supporters in South Carolina were undecided.

Before Super Tuesday, the candidate reaped her best results in that Southern state (40%) and in New Hampshire (42%), which share their status as open primary systems: one does not have to be a registered voter to participate in them, although its necessary to decide in which of the two, Republican or Democrat, one wants to contest. That is why they were two ideal laboratories to analyze the intentions of the always elusive independents. And what came out of those experiments was not good news for Trump, who has galvanized his bases, but these do not add up to enough to give him the White House. The problems are also piling up on Biden’s side, whom the polls show as a loser eight months before the election. These problems stem from his support for Israel in the Gaza war, which angered young people and the Arab population and earned him a punishment vote in the primaries; from the feeling among the public that the economy is not doing as well as he claims; and from the disappointment of Black voters, who expected more from his promises. After passing the test of the State of the Union speech — which made the Democratic base breathe a sigh of relief and at times seemed more like a political rally —, the president has embarked since Friday on a week of electoral events in six decisive states, from Pennsylvania to Michigan, and from Georgia to Wisconsin.

His campaign, better financed at this point than that of his Republican opponent, is speeding up: he plans to open more than a hundred offices around the country in March and hire some 350 employees. It is urgent to turn around data such as the Times/Siena poll, which last week not only gave Trump as the winner, but also concluded that 83% of Biden’s voters in 2020 plan to support the president again, compared to 97% in the case of the tycoon.

The effect of polarization

“In a polarized time like this, we know that Republicans vote Republican; and Democrats, Democrat,” explains University of Arizona professor Thom Reilly in a phone interview. “That’s why the focus should be on those who define themselves as independents. If I were asked for an opinion, I would tell the parties to focus on figuring out what are the issues that would mobilize those voters. In Trump’s case, it seems that a guilty plea in one of his four pending court cases could be the determining factor in driving them away. It’s certainly the million-dollar question,” adds Reilly, who founded the “only center dedicated to the study of independent voters in the United States” — Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy — a couple of years ago, and in 2023 co-wrote The Independent Voter, the most comprehensive essay on the subject to date.

It looks like a field of study with a future. Since the late 1980s, Gallup has been calculating the evolution of the percentage of these undecided voters in the U.S. system; last year it concluded that an all-time high of 43% had been reached. If they were to unite their wills, they would form the majority party in the United States. “That’s what is often said, but, beware, one of the most common mistakes is to consider them as a homogeneous bloc, situated in one part of the political spectrum, the center, for example,” warns Reilly. “The truth is that it is never quite like that; they are all over the place. Many are centrists, but there are also those at the extremes.”

In this election, several projects seek to resurrect the old dream of the creation of a third party. On the one hand, there are the candidacies of anti-vaccine politician Robert Kennedy Jr. and the possible carryover of his illustrious last name, and Black thinker Cornel West. And there is a centrist coalition called No Labels, which on Friday confirmed it was sticking with its plans to run a “unity ticket,” with a Republican candidate for president, and a Democrat as a vice presidential contender. Similar efforts have failed in the past. At best, they succeeded in hurting one side, and made good on a famous dictum by the American historian Richard Hofstadter (1916-1970): “Third parties are like bees. Once they have stung, they die.”

The growth of the independents cannot be understood without taking into account the weakening of the traditional political formations, whose pollsters, Reilly clarifies, often err in considering the undecideds won for good if in a certain election they decided to vote for them. “They don’t want to realize that it’s an unpredictable group. Nor that people are abandoning the parties in a pretty dramatic way,” the expert clarifies. “If you look at young people, Generation Z, the trend is even more pronounced. Between 60 and 65% identify themselves as independent. What’s more, they have never been part of a party, which they see as hyper-polarized, and many are disillusioned. They feel they are disenfranchised in the name of a binary system.”

Polls for the November elections have identified another group that can be decisive: they add up to 20% and are known as the “double haters,” because they hate both Trump and Biden. On the Democratic side, these polls certify the low enthusiasm among young people for the president and his military support for Israel. One of the big unknowns on election night will be to see how much they abstain. “Although that,” says Reilly, “doesn’t necessarily make them politically disengaged, which is another of the misconceptions about independents.”

It is simply another way of getting involved, different from that of the Baby Boom generation, whose political history in this country flowed naturally through their partisan identification. Historian Michael Kazin belongs to that old school: he has been associated since the 1960s, with its comings and goings, with the Democratic Party, to which he dedicated What It Took to Win, a sort of biography of a bicentennial political formation, which in reality is an amalgam of interests that are not always well-matched, as is now becoming clear.

The genuine and the inclined

Kazin believes, with other analysts, that only a minority of independents are truly that way. “Most vote fairly consistently for candidates of one party or the other, but they don’t want to identify with them at a time when so many Americans dislike what they see as an unprincipled struggle for power between Democrats and Republicans,” he explains in an email.

That genuine minority is usually between 10% and 13% of the electorate, but Reilly finds that figure “disdainful” because he believes it is distorted by another category of voters, the “leaners.” These are independents who, after declaring themselves as such, answer the pollster’s question about which party they feel closer to by choosing one of the two. “If you look at the data over time, you’ll see that in the last presidential election, Biden beat Trump by 13 points among independents. In the 2016 ones, the mogul pulled four points ahead of Hillary Clinton. And in the previous ones, Obama took them by eight points. That shows that they are not leaners, but rather unpredictable,” he adds.

When asked if he observes such disaffection from young people among his students at Georgetown in Washington, Kazin replies that he makes it a rule not to ask them who they vote for. “This is a liberal campus in a liberal city (and area), so few students identify themselves as conservatives. I’m pretty sure a large majority will vote Democrat, if they vote at all. It’s also true that both parties have few affiliates on campus, and one would expect at least the Democratic chapter to be larger, given that we’re in a city where politics floods everything.” This Saturday, on a rainy morning, not a single student was to be found on campus who was a registered voter, and a few who were unmotivated to go to the polls in November.

Colin Seeberger, senior advisor to the Washington-based progressive think tank Center for American Progress Action Fund, believes this also has to do with the discrediting of institutions, “not just political ones.” “Young people don’t want to be pigeonholed into any particular group, where they feel they wouldn’t have an easy time forming their own opinions and expressing them,” he says.

And which side does Seeberger think independents will fall on during the campaign? “It’s too early to tell, but Trump has made it very clear that he’s not interested in having the support of anyone who disagrees with him. Everything has to be 100% MAGA [as in his Make America Great Again slogan],” he responds, before citing four recent polls that give Biden a lead among independents (the largest of all is the one given to him by the Fox News poll: nine points). In his opinion, that is because, as was seen in the 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2023 elections, “Trump’s magaextremism ends up being unpopular.”

For his part, César Martínez, a strategist specializing in the Latino vote who worked in four presidential elections with Republican candidates and who in 2020 did so against Trump, agrees with Seeberger that the tycoon “is making his campaign tent smaller and smaller, exclusive,” and that it will be interesting to see how the Hispanic electorate behaves, which is “the minority that tends to oscillate the most between both parties.” “That’s what gives them their strength,” Martínez considers.

To venture what lies ahead until November, the strategist resorts to a movie simile. “Remember that movie, Grumpy Old Men [1993]? In that movie, Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon were vying for Ann-Margret’s attention. Well, this campaign will be like a sequel to that story, with two 80-year-old white guys fighting for America. Neither can sell a future,” he says. Within that analogy, independents would be that part of the audience that attends the film “quietly,” “watching and analyzing,” and who will know who they are voting for when they leave the theater on November 5, election day. The only sure thing is that, whatever they decide, it will give the presidency to one “grumpy old man” or the other.",3/10/2024,Iker Seisdedos,El Pais,"[{""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""November elections""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""RNC""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""District of Columbia""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""South Carolina""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican National Committee""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Lara Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Vermont""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Super Tuesday""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Nikki Haley""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""U.S. elections""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Michael Whatley""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""White House""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}]",0.42
Biden gives fiery response when asked about 'widely shared' belief that he's overseeing a 'genocide' in Gaza,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-gives-fiery-response-when-asked-widely-shared-belief-overseeing-genocide-gaza,"About 100,000 Democrats voted ""uncommitted"" in the Michigan primary to protest Biden. President Biden refused to concede in a recent interview that it was a ""widely shared sentiment"" he was allowing a ""genocide"" in Gaza in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks. 

MSNBC anchor Jonathan Capehart confronted Biden with a quote from a recent New York Times opinion column titled ""Arab American fury toward Biden."" 

""As bad as Mr. Trump’s rhetoric was, and him putting a travel ban on five Muslim countries, he wasn’t overseeing and actively arming a genocide,"" Dawud Walid, executive director of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in an interview with New York Times opinion columnist Charles Blow. 
""What's your response to that widely shared sentiment?"" Capehart said, quoting from Blow's column. 

""It's not widely shared,"" Biden told Capehart. ""You guys make judgments you're not capable of making. That's not what all those people said. What they said was they're very upset, and I don't blame them for being upset. There are families there, there are people who are dying and they want something done about it. And they're saying, ‘Joe, do something, do something.'"" 

""But the idea that they all think it's genocide, that's a different situation,"" he added. 

""I can fully understand, can't you?"" Biden asked Capehart. 

""It's understandable [why] they feel that way,"" Biden said of voters who may have family members who have been affected by the war in Gaza. ""And that's why I'm trying to do everything that I can to try to stop it."" Capehart also questioned Biden in that exchange about his plans to visit Michigan as another stop at a critical swing state in advance of the 2024 presidential election. The anchor raised the issue of tens of thousands of voters who marked ""uncommitted"" as a sign of protest against the president. 

About 100,000 Democrats voted ""uncommitted"" in the primary last month due to anger at Biden over his Middle East policies, with marked support in Detroit, Michigan, especially as a city with a heavy Arab-American population.

Far-left Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., also supported the uncommitted vote in her state last month. On Election Day, the anti-Israel politician said she was ""proud"" to oppose Biden.

""I was proud today to walk in and pull a Democratic ballot and vote uncommitted. We must protect our democracy, we must make sure that our government is about us, about the people,"" Tlaib said. ""When 74% of Democrats in Michigan support a cease-fire, yet President Biden is not hearing us, this is the way we can use our democracy to say listen.""

""Listen to the families right now that have been directly impacted, but also listen to the majority of Americans that are saying enough. No more wars, no more using our dollars to fund a genocide,"" she said.

Jan 6 committee allegedly suppressed testimony showing Trump admin pushed for National Guard presence: report,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jan-6-committee-allegedly-suppressed-testimony-showing-trump-admin-pushed-national-guard-presence-report,"Former Rep Liz Cheney's spokesperson says report 'flatly false'. The Jan. 6 congressional committee allegedly falsely claimed it did not have evidence that showed former President Trump’s administration requested National Guard assistance, according to a report detailing a ""hidden transcript"" that was recently released. 

""The former J6 Select Committee apparently withheld Mr. Ornato’s critical witness testimony from the American people because it contradicted their pre-determined narrative. Mr. Ornato’s testimony proves what Mr. Meadows has said all along: President Trump did in fact offer 10,000 National Guard troops to secure the U.S. Capitol, which was turned down,"" Georgia Republican Rep. Barry Loudermilk said in a statement on Friday.

Loudermilk released a transcript of former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Anthony Ornato’s interview with the congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 on Friday, following The Federalist’s Mollie Hemingway, also a Fox News contributor, reporting, ""Former Rep. Liz Cheney’s January 6 Committee suppressed evidence"" that the Trump administration pushed for 10,000 National Guard members to be on the streets. 

Ornato’s interview was conducted in January 2022 and attended by Cheney, among other members on the committee. In addition to serving as deputy chief of staff under Trump, Ornato served in the Secret Service for decades. The committee, which included seven Democrats and two now-former Republican Congress members, Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, concluded that it found ""no evidence"" that the Trump administration called for 10,000 National Guard members to Washington, D.C., to protect the Capitol.

Trump has long claimed that he requested the National Guard but that then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., failed to act on the request. Amid and following the congressional committee’s investigation, media outlets such as the Washington Post ""debunked"" Trump’s comments, repeatedly awarding him ""Four Pinocchios.""

Loudermilk on Friday released a transcript of Ornato’s interview with the committee that details how he allegedly overheard then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows asking D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to request as much protection for D.C. as she needed.

""When it comes to the National Guard statement about having 10,000 troops or any other number of troops, do you recall any discussion prior to the 6th about whether and how many National Guard troops to deploy on January 6th?"" a staffer with the committee asked Ornato. ""I remember he had – he was on the phone with [Bowser], and we – I had walked in for something, and I was there, and he was on the phone with her and wanted to make sure she had everything that she needed. Because I think it was the concern of anti and pro groups clashing is what I recall. And not anywhere near the Capitol, this was just out on the mall area or at the event; and wanted to know if she needed any more guardsmen,"" Ornato responded, according to the transcript reviewed by Fox News Digital. 

Ornato went on to cite the ""10,000"" guardsmen number, according to the transcript, arguing Trump wanted ""to make sure that you have enough.""

""And I remember the number 10,000 coming up of, you know, the President wants to make sure that you have enough. You know, he is willing to ask for 10,000. I remember that number. Now that you said it, it reminded me of it. And that she was all set. She had, I think it was like 350 or so for intersection control and those types of thing not in the law enforcement capacity at the time. And then that's the only thing I recall with that number 10,000 National Guard guardsmen,"" he continued. Bowser ultimately asked for just over 300 National Guard members, requesting that they not be armed and only work to assist local police.
Ornato said in his interview with the committee that after Bowser refused additional National Guard members, the White House requested the Defense Department have a ""quick reaction force"" on hand.
""The only thing I remember with DOD and the National Guard was even though the mayor didn’t want any more National Guard in D.C., that a request was made to have kind of a, lack of better term, a quick reaction force out at Joint Base Andrews being that it was a military installation,"" Ornato said in his interview, according to the transcript.

""I remember Chief Meadows talking to DOD about that, I believe. I remember Chief Meadows letting me know that, ‘Hey, there was going to be National Guard that’s going to be at Joint Base Andrews in case they’re going to need some more, we’re going to – the Mayor would need any, we’re going to make sure they’re out there.'""

Cheney spokesperson Jeremy Adler told Fox News Digital on Sunday morning that The Federalist’s report is ""flatly false.""
""The Federalist report is flatly false. No transcripts were destroyed, and as this letter (which has long been public) describes in detail, the Committee adhered to its obligations to allow the Secret Service to protect sensitive security information for interviews of its agents before preserving that testimony in the archives,"" Adler said in a statement.
""Also, relevant content of the Secret Service transcripts was summarized in multiple places in the report… This is all a continuation of efforts to lie about and cover up Donald Trump’s culpability for January 6th,"" he added, providing links to summarized Secret Service transcripts.
Cheney also took to X this weekend and referred to the report as ""BS"" while responding to a tweet posted by Mark Levin.

Levin responded to Cheney on X, saying, ""I wrote it, moron. You’re a pathetic disgrace and demagogue. And have exposed yourself for all time. Funny how you avoid public debates with your detractors, including me. Coward. You should consider professional help.""

Meadows was reportedly worried about the crowd size ahead of Jan. 6, including from left-wing protesters, according to The Federalist’s report, which pointed to Ornato’s transcript detailing how members of the Trump administration wanted to ensure there were enough troops on the streets. 
""And, again, the crowd sizes were, you know, the organizers were saying, you know, there may be 50,000 here. So that’s where it started, I think, to scare the chief a little bit of how many people were coming in for this event, and wanted to make sure that they would be able to bring in National Guard if needed for this size of this many people inside D.C.,"" Ornato said.
When supporters of former President Trump ultimately breached the Capitol, Ornato said in his interview that the White House called on then-Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller to deploy assistance.
""So then I remember the chief saying, ‘Hey, I’m calling secretary of defense to get that [quick reaction force] in here,'"" Ornato said. 
""[T]he constant was, you know, where is the National Guard? Why isn’t – you know, we’ve got to get control of this,"" Ornato added.

""But, you know, [Meadows] understood the urgency, that’s for sure. And he kept, you know, getting Miller on the phone, wanting to know where they were, why aren’t they there yet,"" he later added. 

Hemingway detailed in her report that Ornato’s testimony matched what former Trump administration aide Kash Patel said during testimony amid Colorado’s failed efforts to boot Trump from the ballot over claims his 2024 presidential run violates the 14th Amendment. 
""Mayor Bowser wrote a letter herself on approximately Jan. 4.… declining further requests for National Guard services outside of the 346 National Guardsmen already authorized,"" Patel said late last year in testimony. 
""The authorization came in beforehand. It was relayed to the appropriate officials in D.C. and the Capitol Police. It was declined, and we acted when their request finally came in on January 6,"" he continued.
The judge in the Colorado case determined Patel was not a credible witness. 
Mark Hemingway, senior writer at Real Clear Investigations, also responded to Cheney's tweet to Levin this weekend, saying Cheney was using ""disingenuous circular logic"" by citing Patel as not being a credible witness. 

Last year, a group of Colorado voters brought a lawsuit arguing Trump should be deemed ineligible from holding political office under a Civil War-era insurrection clause and that his name should thus be barred from appearing on the 2024 ballot. The group said Trump’s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters breached the U.S. Capitol, violated a clause in the 14th Amendment that prevents officers of the United States, members of Congress or state legislatures who ""engaged in insurrection or rebellion"" against the Constitution from holding political office.

The case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which unanimously ruled in Trump’s favor, allowing him to remain on the Colorado ballot and squelching other states’ efforts to remove the former president from their ballots. 
Ornato said the Trump White House on Jan. 6 continually asked, ""What’s taking so long?"" to deploy assistance to the city, but the rollout was allegedly riddled with hangups. 
""Every time [Meadows] would ask, ‘What’s taking so long?’ It would be, like, you know, ‘This isn’t just start the car and we’re there. We have to muster them up, we have to’ – so it was constant excuses coming of – not excuses, but what they were actually doing to get them there,"" he said. ""So, you know, ‘We only have so many here right now. They’re given an hour to get ready.’ So there’s, like, all these timelines that was being explained to the chief. And he relayed that, like, you know – he’s like, ‘I don’t care, just get them here,’ you know, and ‘Get them to the Capitol, not to the White House.'""

The Jan. 6 report detailed that then-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chair Gen. Mark Milley said then-Vice President Mike Pence had called Miller at least two times to request a National Guard presence and that Meadows had allegedly called to ""kill the narrative that the Vice President is making all the decisions.""
""In contrast, according to General Milley, Chief of Staff Meadows called and said, ‘We have to kill the narrative that the Vice President is making all the decisions. We need to establish the narrative, you know, that the President is still in charge and that things are steady or stable,’ or words to that effect. I immediately interpreted that as politics, politics, politics,’"" the report states. 
The report states Trump did not personally make a call. 
Just days before Jan. 6, 2021, an op-ed penned by former defense secretaries, including Liz Cheney’s father, Dick Cheney, argued against involving the military in election disputes. Hemingway cited a report in her piece that Liz Cheney ""organized"" the op-ed and had allegedly ""‘secretly orchestrated’ a pressure campaign to prevent the Defense Department from deploying resources on January 6, 2021.""

Trump has meanwhile previously claimed that Cheney ""deleted"" evidence that his administration wanted a greater presence of National Guard members.
""Why did American Disaster Liz Cheney … ILLEGALLY DELETE & DESTROY most of the evidence, and related items, from the January 6th Committee of Political Thugs and Misfits. THIS ACT OF EXTREME SABOTAGE MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR MY LAWYERS TO PROPERLY PREPARE FOR, AND PRESENT, A PROPER DEFENSE OF THEIR CLIENT, ME. All of the information on Crazy Nancy Pelosi turning down 10,000 soldiers that I offered to to [sic] guard the Capitol Building, and beyond, is gone,"" Trump posted on Truth Social on Jan. 1, 2024.
The committee's final report determined that Trump ""never gave any order to deploy the National Guard.""

""President Trump had authority and responsibility to direct deployment of the National Guard in the District of Columbia, but never gave any order to deploy the National Guard on January 6th or on any other day. Nor did he instruct any Federal law enforcement agency to assist. Because the authority to deploy the National Guard had been delegated to the Department of Defense, the Secretary of Defense could, and ultimately did deploy the Guard,"" the report states. 
In his Friday statement and transcript release, Loudermilk said the committee ""hid"" Ornato’s testimony. Loudermilk is chair of the House Administration’s Subcommittee on Oversight, which is looking into the Jan. 6 committee’s handling of the investigation. 
""This is just one example of important information the former Select Committee hid from the public because it contradicted what they wanted the American people to believe. And, this is exactly why my investigation is committed to uncovering all the facts, no matter the outcome,"" Loudermilk said in his statement. ",3/10/2024,Emma Colton,Fox News,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""J6 Select Committee""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Washington, D.C.""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""U.S. Capitol""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Secret Service""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Washington Post""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Adam Kinzinger""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Barry Loudermilk""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Liz Cheney""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""White House""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Anthony Ornato""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""President Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Fox News""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Nancy Pelosi""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Mollie Hemingway""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Mr. Ornato""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Jan. 6""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Capitol""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""National Guard""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""The Federalist""}]",0.46
Joe Biden Tackles Criticism of His Age Head-On,https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-tackles-criticism-his-age-head-1877677,"President Joe Biden has taken on concerns about his age head-on in a new campaign ad and social media post as his reelection campaign begins to accelerate.

While they have yet to be formally declared the presumptive nominees, Biden and former President Donald Trump are the overwhelming favorites to secure the 2024 nominations for the Democratic and Republican parties, respectively, setting up a 2020 rematch in November's general election. In recent months, polls for the hypothetical match-up have overall averaged out to show the two candidates neck-and-neck with voters. Republican opponents of the president have, in turn, attempted to position age as a key argument against Biden's presidency, citing some instances in speeches where he appears to flub lines or mix-up terms. Some have even gone so far as to allege that he is secretly suffering from senility or dementia. Supporters of Biden have countered these claims, highlighting the president's numerous accomplishments and noting Trump's own age-related struggles. Trump is only four years younger than Biden, and opponents have cited numerous recent instances of slurred speech, mispronunciation, and mixed-up names in public addresses and rallies to argue that his cognitive health is worse than his Democratic rival.

As Biden's reelection begins to accelerate heading into the spring, he has taken on the concerns about his age head-on, in a Sunday post to the official presidential account on X, formerly Twitter, and in a new campaign ad. In the new ad that was released on Saturday, Biden begins by stating, ""I'm not a young guy. That's no secret. But, here's the deal. I understand how to get things done for the American people."" The president then proceeds to lay out the various high-profile accomplishments of his first term, including the passage of a major infrastructure bill, lowering prescription drug costs, capping insulin prices for seniors, and leading the U.S. pandemic recovery efforts.

The video also ends on a humorous note, with Biden questioning the need for an ad addressing concerns about his age in a bit presented as coming in response for a request to do one more take.

""Look, I'm very young, energetic, and handsome!"" Biden says in the ad. ""What the hell am I doing this for?""

Newsweek reached out to the Biden campaign via email on Sunday for comment. Any responses received will be added to this story in a later update.

As he was 78 at the time of his inauguration in January 2021, Biden is the oldest individual in U.S. history to hold the office of the presidency. Throughout his term, concerns about his advanced age have persisted among voters, who have frequently told pollsters they believe he is too old to be president and that he should not run for a second term, despite there being little to no historical precedent for such a move.",3/10/2024,Thomas Kika,Newsweek,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""X""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Twitter""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""reelection campaign""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democratic""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""U.S.""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""general election""}]",0.52
Trump Criticizes Biden For Expressing Regret Over Labeling Laken Riley's Alleged Killer As 'Illegal',https://www.ibtimes.com/trump-criticizes-biden-expressing-regret-over-labeling-laken-rileys-alleged-killer-illegal-3726830,"Former president Donald Trump slammed President Joe Biden for expressing regret on Saturday in using the term ""illegal"" with reference to the person suspected of killing Georgia nursing student Laken Riley.

Biden apologized after some members of his political party expressed annoyance at the president's use of the term to characterize individuals who entered the country illegally.

""I shouldn't have used illegal, it's undocumented,"" he said in an interview with NBC news.

Biden used the term last Thursday when he was pressuring Republicans to approve the bipartisan border security agreement in his speech. The president was then yelled at by staunch Trump supporter Greene to mention Riley's name, adding that she was killed ""by an illegal."" ""By an illegal, that's right,"" Biden responded immediately, before appearing to ask how many people are being killed by ""legals.""

In the run-up to the 2024 presidential election, Republicans are mobilizing around Riley's murder and the Biden administration's handling of the immigration crisis at the US-Mexico border.

Meanwhile, Donald Trump, attacked the Democrat's immigration policies and blamed them for Riley's death at a rally in Georgia. In contrast to Biden's apology, the former president called out Riley's alleged killer as 'an illegal alien.'

""Joe Biden went on television and apologized for calling Laken's murderer an illegal,"" he said in his campaign rally, joined by Riley's parents, her sister, and friends on Saturday. ""Biden should be apologizing for apologizing to this killer.""

""What Joe Biden has done on our border is a crime against humanity and the people of this nation for which he will never be forgiven,"" Trump added.

During his State of the Union address this past week, Biden also came under fire from Trump for his handling of Riley's name and border policies in a nearly two-hour speech. Biden, accompanied by his wife Jill and both of Georgia's Democratic senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, held the rally at the trendy Pullman Yards facility on Atlanta's east side before a crowd of about 500 people.

In his State of the Union, Biden did address Riley's parents, expressing that having lost two children himself, he is aware of the suffering that comes with child loss.

Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student, was killed while she was jogging on the campus of the University of Georgia. Jose Ibarra, a 26-year-old Venezuelan national who is accused of being an illegal immigrant and facing charges of felony murder, kidnapping, and false imprisonment, was taken into custody by the police. Since Laken's murder, the US House of Representatives has passed the Laken Riley Act. The act requires the federal detention of illegal immigrants who have committed burglary or theft.",3/10/2024,Litty Simon,International Business Times,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Biden administration""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024 presidential election""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""US-Mexico""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden responded immediately, before appearing to ask how many people""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Jill""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Laken Riley""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""NBC news""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""State of the Union""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Greene""}]",0.52
Buttigieg defends Biden’s age: ‘What matters is the age of a leader’s ideas,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/10/buttigieg-biden-age-election,"Comments come amid voters’ views on president’s age continue to be a growing liability for his re-election campaign. Top Democrats came to Joe Biden’s defense on Sunday, emphasizing the president’s viability for re-election amid his colleagues’ worries that voters see him as too old – concerns compounded by Donald Trump’s lead over him in recent polls.

On ABC This Week, host George Stephanopoulos pointedly asked Biden’s transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg: “How can an 81-year-old incumbent be the candidate of change? It’s so critical in presidential elections.”

Buttigieg replied that Biden’s administration had focused on “issues that matter most to newer generations”, including addressing the climate crisis, supporting LGBTQ+ rights and pushing to restore the federal abortion rights that Roe v Wade had established before the conservative-dominated US supreme court eliminated them in 2022.

“What matters most is the age of a leaders’ ideas,” Buttigieg said.

Buttigieg’s comments came as voters’ views on Biden’s age continue being a growing liability for his re-election campaign. A recent ABC/Ipsos poll found that 86% of Americans thought him too old to serve another term. Sixty-two percent thought the same about Trump, who is 77 – and 59% of voters think both are too old.

Those numbers prompted Biden’s camp to kick off a $30m ad campaign in swing states with a spot directly addressing the president’s age. “Look, I’m not a young guy,” he says in the spot. “But I understand how to get things done for the American people.”

Georgia’s Democratic US senator Raphael Warnock also defended Biden’s chances in the swing state despite signs that many voters there have turned away from him, saying, “It’s still early in this election season.”

Warnock’s comments on Sunday on CNN’s State of the Union referred to a Fox News poll showing Trump leading by eight percentage points in Georgia. The poll also showed that a quarter of Black voters there now favor the former president.

“I can tell you, as somebody whose name has been on the ballot five times in three years, I know a little something about Georgia voters,” Warnock said. “We’ve seen both of these men serve in the White House. Their choice is clearly Joe Biden and Georgians get it right for Joe Biden, just as they got it right for me.”

CNN host Jake Tapper suggested third-party candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr could be a spoiler after he claims to have gathered enough signatures to get on the ballot in Georgia in November. Tapper said Biden defeated Trump in Georgia in 2020 by fewer than 12,000 votes. But Warnock argued there was still time for Biden to secure the state again.

The Democratic House leader, Hakeem Jeffries, also addressed Black voters’ seemingly fading support of Biden. During Jeffries’s appearance on Face The Nation, host Margaret Brennan noted that Biden’s support among Black voters had fallen from 90% in 2020 to 76%.

Nonetheless, Jeffries said Black voters would understand that Biden “has delivered over and over and over again on issues of concern”, including by helping bring on the lowest Black unemployment rate in decades as well as making historic investments in Black colleges and universities.

“I’m confident at the end of the day … the overwhelming majority of African Americans, Caribbean Americans, Black voters throughout the country, will support president Biden,” Jeffries said. Brennan separately asked Senator Bernie Sanders whether he could good “in good conscience” ask fellow progressives who oppose Israel’s ongoing military strikes in Gaza to support the president.

The US has provided billions of dollars in financial aid to Israel’s military as Biden has exalted the country’s right to defend itself after the 7 October attack by Hamas that reportedly killed more than 1,200 Israelis. But the president has condemned the humanitarian crisis set off by Israel’s subsequent military strikes in Gaza, which have reportedly killed more than 30,000.

Sanders said the US “cannot be complicit in this mass slaughter” and called on Biden to withhold funds from Israel’s military if the country’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, continued exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But Sanders said voters must pick Biden if they favored protecting the climate, preserving bodily autonomy and eliminating income inequality.

“So you’re asking voters to put [Gaza] aside?” Brennan said.

Sanders responded: “Not put this aside – but fight continuously to change Biden’s policy on Gaza.”",3/10/2024,Victoria Bekiempis,The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""ABC""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""re-election campaign""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Fox News""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""swing states""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Roe v Wade""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""presidential elections""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Pete Buttigieg""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Raphael Warnock""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""ABC/Ipsos""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""$30m ad campaign""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""George Stephanopoulos""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""CNN""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""US supreme court""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""State of the Union""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}]",0.6
One of the top donors to a pro-Biden dark-money group is a non-profit run by an early AI investor,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/10/politics/pro-biden-dark-money-group-invs/index.html,"A husband-and-wife duo whose fortune has ties to AI investments and cryptocurrency trading are quietly emerging as some of the largest backers of the main dark-money group boosting President Joe Biden.
The second-largest donation in 2022 to the non-profit arm of Future Forward, the primary Super PAC supporting Biden, came from a group run by James McClave and Emily Berger. The couple work at Jane Street, a Manhattan trading firm, and McClave was an early investor in the AI company Anthropic.
Tax records reviewed by CNN, which have not been previously reported, show that BEMC 4 Association — a non-profit whose only two executives are McClave and Berger — gave $7.2 million to Future Forward USA Action in 2022, the most recent year for which data is available. That’s more than any group other than the George Soros-linked Open Society Policy Center, which gave $15.2 million that year. Like some other prominent political organizations on both sides of the aisle, Future Forward operates as two linked groups: a Super PAC, FF PAC, which is required to publicly disclose its donors, and a non-profit, Future Forward USA Action, which is not. Both groups are allowed to run ads supporting or opposing candidates, although the non-profit is not allowed to make that its “primary activity,” according to IRS rules.

After Future Forward ran ads backing Biden and Democrats during the 2020 and 2022 campaigns, the Biden campaign publicly signaled that it had become their preferred Super PAC. Anita Dunn, a senior White House advisor, told the New York Times last year that the group had “really earned its place as the pre-eminent Super PAC supporting the Biden-Harris agenda and 2024 efforts.”

Future Forward has said that it raised a combined $208 million in 2023 between its Super PAC and non-profit. The bulk of that appears to have been raised by the dark-money non-profit, as the PAC only reported raising about $25 million over the year, and more than $8 million of that was transferred from the non-profit, according to Federal Election Commission records.

It’s not clear whether McClave and Berger or their non-profit made additional donations to Future Forward last year – their group won’t be required to report grants it made in 2023 until after the election this November, and won’t have to report its 2024 spending until November 2025.

Biden himself has criticized the influence of dark money, and supported legislation that would require organizations that spend money on elections to disclose large donors more promptly.

“There’s much — too much money that flows in the shadows to influence our elections,” Biden declared in a White House speech in 2022, adding that “dark money erodes public trust.”

“Right now, advocacy groups can run ads on issues attacking or supporting a candidate right until Election Day without exposing who’s paying for that ad,” Biden said – describing the kind of ads that Future Forward USA Action could run backing him later this year.

Biden’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

In addition to supporting Future Forward, McClave and Berger’s non-profit also gave another $7 million in 2022 to the Center for Voter Information, a group that works to encourage young people, women and minorities to vote and is run by a former Democratic political operative. It also made smaller donations to two other left-leaning groups.

McClave and Berger are also the officers of the similarly named BEMC Foundation, a private foundation that has given a total of about $2.5 million in recent years to Vox Media’s Future Perfect Project, which produces news stories on global issues.

While Future Forward USA Action does not disclose its donors, other non-profits that give to it report those contributions – and CNN analyzed tax filing data released by the IRS to uncover some of them. Other than the Soros group and BEMC, the group’s top contributors in 2022 included other left-leaning non-profits such as the League of Conservation Voters and the Fund for a Better Future, which gave $2.5 million each, and the Hopewell Fund, which gave about $1.55 million.
The millions flowing through Future Forward is an example of how wealthy donors on both sides of the aisle are using dark-money groups to shape American politics while staying under the radar. And even as Democrats like Biden have criticized the impact of dark money and pushed for reforms, they’re also major beneficiaries of the system. That trend is set to continue this year: Future Forward has announced plans to run the largest ever political advertising campaign by a Super PAC in 2024.
Spending by groups that don’t disclose their donors “ends up leaving voters in the dark when they go to the polls,” said Anna Massoglia, the investigations manager at the campaign finance watchdog group OpenSecrets. “They don’t have any information about who’s giving until after the election, if at all… that’s very important so they can know who’s fueling the candidates they’re voting for, and what special interests are playing a role.”


The tax records don’t confirm whether the $7.2 million is from McClave and Berger personally, or other donors to the group they control. But the only donations BEMC reported receiving were in the form of interest in a financial holding company or partnership. And it’s not uncommon for large donors to create new non-profits to distribute their own money, Massoglia said.
[Voters] don’t have any information about who’s giving until after the election, if at all… that’s very important so they can know who’s fueling the candidates they’re voting for, and what special interests are playing a role.”
Anna Massoglia, OpenSecrets
While McClave and Berger don’t have much of a public profile, they have been quietly increasing their political spending. The couple have given more than $1 million in total in recent years to a wide variety of other Democratic Party groups and candidates in federal and state elections, records show – becoming top donors to progressives such as Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Janet Protasiewicz and Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg.
McClave was an early investor in Anthropic, which runs the AI chatbot Claude, participating in the company’s Series A and Series B rounds in 2021 and 2022. He was co-investors in the company with FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried – who used to work at Jane Street and was also a major campaign donor – before Bankman-Fried’s financial collapse and conviction for fraud and conspiracy.
Jane Street has been an important player in cryptocurrency trading, and McClave has shown an interest in the federal government’s crypto policies. In 2022, he wrote a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission urging the regulator to allow a Bitcoin fund to be listed on a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange.

Democrats are angry over media coverage of Biden. Is it a distraction?,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/10/democrats-joe-biden-media-coverage-donald-trump,"Fury at the New York Times followed frustration at the justice system. Critics say the president’s supporters are aiming at the wrong targets. When an opinion poll in the New York Times found that a majority of Joe Biden’s voters believe he is too old to be an effective US president, the call to action was swift. But it was not aimed at Joe Biden.

“Amplifying flawed presidential polls, refusing to report on [Donald] Trump’s cognitive issues, the NYT is biased for Trump,” was a sample response on social media. “If you have a subscription to NYT, cancel it.”

The irate chorus aimed at one of America’s most storied media institutions followed finger-pointing at the legal system for failing to stop Trump in his tracks. Despite much wishful thinking, primary election results this week made clear that the nation is hurtling towards a Biden v Trump rematch in November.

That polling and media coverage are imperfect, and the wheels of justice of turn slowly, is beyond dispute. But whatever the merits of the arguments, critics argue that Democrats are at risk of playing a blame game that distracts them from the central mission: defeating Trump at the ballot box.

Tara Setmayer, a senior adviser to the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, said: “Commiseration is not a strategy and Democrats need to stop throwing political temper tantrums and do the work to unify and get Joe Biden re-elected. The courts, the media, late-night comedians are not going to save us. So this whining and complaining about these aspects being unfair is not a strategy for victory.” Among some Democrats, there has long been a yearning for a saviour who will stop Trump in his tracks. Hopes were pinned on the special counsel Robert Mueller, but his Russia investigation lacked teeth and failed to bring the president down. Two impeachments came and went and the Senate missed a historic opportunity to bar from Trump running again.

Now resentment is focused on the supreme court and the attorney general, Merrick Garland, for dragging their feet on holding Trump accountable for his role in the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol. The court issued a unanimous decision that Colorado and other states do not have the power to remove Trump from the ballot for engaging in an insurrection.

A justice department case alleging that he sought to overturn the 2020 election, which had been due to begin this week, was postponed until the supreme court rules on whether he is immune from prosecution. And an election interference case in Georgia is also on hold because the prosecutor Fani Willis is dealing with allegations of a conflict of interest over a romantic relationship.

In Florida, where Trump is charged over his mishandling of classified government documents, he managed to draw a friendly judge who has indicated the trial will not start soon. That means the case likely to start first is one in New York relating to Trump paying hush money to an adult film star during the 2016 election campaign, widely portrayed in the media as the weakest of the four.

Yet such a case would have been devastating to any other candidate at any other moment in history. Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University in Washington, said: “He’s going to be on trial for 34 felony counts in less than three weeks and the mainstream media has barely indicated the importance of this.

“‘Oh, it’s just a hush money trial.’ No it’s not. He’s not on trial for hush money. He’s on trial for election fraud, not just paying the hush money but deceiving the American people by concealing it as a business expense.” Lichtman added: “If this was anybody but Trump, any other presidential candidate on trial, it would be the trial of the century and the mainstream media would be screaming that, if the candidate got convicted, he should be bounced from from the campaign. Instead they’ve misrepresented and trivialised this case.”

Trump has long challenged media orthodoxies. During the 2016 campaign, the New York Times used the word “lie” in a headline – a move that would have been seen as judgmental and editorialising in the pre-Trump era. In 2019, the paper changed a headline, “Trump urges unity vs racism”, after an outcry from readers and progressive politicians.

Television has also struggled to find the right approach. There was much introspection over how saturation coverage of Trump’s 2016 campaign rallies and tweets gave him $5bn in free advertising, according to the media tracking firm mediaQuant. Cable news networks have drastically reduced their live coverage of Trump’s speeches, although some commentators warn that the pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction, contending that voters need to see his unhinged antics, verbal gaffes and extremist agenda.

With Super Tuesday’s primary elections clearing the way for another Biden v Trump clash, some accuse the media of focusing too much on polls and not enough on the stakes, treating Trump as just another political candidate rather than an existential threat. They say the intense focus on Biden’s age – he is 81 – is wildly disproportionate when set against Trump’s authoritarianism and 91 criminal charges.


Setmayer, a former Republican communications director on Capitol Hill, said: “The media has clearly not learned its lesson from 2016 or 2020 on how to cover Donald Trump. This is not a conventional horse race election. There’s nothing normal about any of this so, by covering Biden and Trump equally, it minimises Trump’s considerably disturbing behaviour, comments and plans for the future.

“The Democrats do have a legitimate complaint with the way the media is bothsides-ing this. The media should not be under any obligation to tell both sides of a lie or conspiracy theory or leading presidential candidate’s desire to tear up the constitution and become a dictator on day one. All things Donald Trump has said he would do.”

The New York Times/Siena College poll was made up of 980 registered voters across the country and conducted on mobile and landline phones. It found that 61% of people who supported Biden in 2020 thought he was “just too old” to be an effective president. An accompanying article in the Times was headlined: “Majority of Biden’s 2020 Voters Now Say He’s Too Old to Be Effective.”

Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, thinks it was a fair question. “The media’s not in this to help any candidate and Joe Biden is the incumbent and there are legitimate questions about an 81-year-old repeatedly struggling in public. To do a poll that asks questions about that is entirely fair.” Others take a very different view. Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at the CUNY Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism, said: “The choice to ask the question and the way the question is asked and who the question is asked of and then how the result is played are agenda-filled. Polls become a self-fulfilling prophecy of: we’re going to set an agenda and say it all and then we’re going to do a poll and act as if that’s news when it’s just a reaction to what we’ve already done. This is the case with the age.”


Jarvis added: “The New York Times – which has been our best and which I criticise because I want it to be better - is horribly frustrating because it does not know how to cover the rise of fascism, and that’s what this story really is. Neither does it know how to cover the essence of why this is happening, which is race.”

Defenders of the New York Times point out that it has done extensive reporting on Trump’s plans for a second term and what it would mean for America and the world. Some commentators warn that Democrats’ attacks on the media are likely to backfire and lead to accusations that they are shooting the messenger.

Not even comedians are immune. When Jon Stewart returned to The Daily Show on Comedy Central, and skewered Biden and Trump as the two oldest presidential candidates in history, Mary Trump, a niece and fierce critic of the former president, wrote on X: “Not only is Stewart’s ‘both sides are the same’ rhetoric not funny, it’s a potential disaster for democracy.”

Stewart responded on his next show: “I guess as the famous saying goes, ‘Democracy dies in discussion’ … It was never my intention to say out loud what I saw with my eyes and then brain. I can do better.”

If history is any guide, there is no knight in shining armour coming to Democrats’ rescue. They have to win on the merits on 5 November. Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, observed: “The Democrats have wanted to use every trick in the book to defeat or unseat or stop Trump since 2016 and nothing has changed in that respect.

“The fact is he is a leading candidate. He is supported by almost half the country. The idea that he poses a threat to democracy is not unfounded but is also wildly overblown. If the media did what many Democrats want, they would effectively be acting like media in Orbán’s Hungary, so the irony might be telling.”",3/10/2024,David Smith,The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""impeachments""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Senate""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""NYT""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""supreme court""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""America""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""primary election""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""justice system""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Tara Setmayer""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Lincoln Project""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""New York Times""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Russia""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""legal system""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""US""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald] Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Robert Mueller""}]",0.39
"A forceful Biden hits the road as Republicans keep focus on his age and memory
",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/10/politics/joe-biden-sotu-what-matters/index.html,"Which Joe Biden will Americans see for the next eight months?

Is it the vigorous, smiling president who tangled with Republicans in real time during the high-wire act of a nationally televised address Thursday?

Or is it the “well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory” who a special counsel determined would be too sympathetic to prosecute for mishandling classified data and will be described in testimony this week?

A Biden split screen
The thundering grandfather is hitting the road, taking his State of the Union persona to a monthlong tour of swing states in the hopes of inspiring Democrats to get involved in the election. First up, campaign rallies in the Philadelphia area on Friday and the Atlanta area on Saturday – urban centers in states Biden narrowly won in 2020. His campaign is also launching ad campaigns to target Black and Hispanic audiences as well as March Madness viewers.

Meanwhile, Robert Hur, the special counsel, will be testifying on Capitol Hill about his impression of Biden’s memory lapses during the investigation into classified material (mostly in handwritten notebooks) found in Biden’s Delaware garage and elsewhere.

The other recent example of a forceful Biden moment came after Hur released his report in February absolving the president of criminal wrongdoing but also revealing that investigators found his “memory was significantly limited” during interviews, with the report noting that Biden could not remember when his son died. Biden delivered a harsh rebuke at a hastily called White House news conference.

It’s hard to square the wildly different impressions being pushed at voters:

► If State of the Union Biden is the real deal, why have his advisers not done more to stop the doddering old man perception from festering?

► If he can respond to hecklers in real time during the State of the Union address, why does he not do more interviews? He skipped the opportunity to do a nationally televised interview before the Super Bowl, for instance, and instead released a produced video about the cost of chips and ice cream on social media.

► If he can gladhand on the House floor long after his speech ends, why hasn’t he been more visibly present on the campaign trail? Candidate Biden did recently discuss the possibility of a ceasefire in Gaza on the sidelines of a trip to get ice cream with the late night host Seth Meyers in New York City.

► If he can deliver effective warnings about former President Donald Trump in the House chamber, why does he more frequently say these things off-camera at high dollar fundraisers?

Will he debate Trump?
Vice President Kamala Harris would not commit Friday that Biden would take part in debates with former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee. The administration will “get to that,” she told ABC News, pointing instead to the policy ideas Biden put forward in his Thursday speech – protecting democracy, lowering prescription drug costs, raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing paid family leave.

“At this moment in time when we’re looking at the split screen and the fact that Donald Trump is on the other side, I think that’s an important point for the American people,” she said.

Biden said his goal in the speech was to “wake up Congress.” The more important achievement may be demonstrating to the country that he is indeed awake and capable.

Biden’s use of the derogatory term ‘illegal’
The surprise effect of his energetic State of the Union performance has also allowed some interesting comments that might otherwise have gained more attention to slide past.

Biden used the derogatory and dehumanizing term “illegal” to refer to the man accused of killing Laken Riley, the nursing student in Georgia who was found dead last month and whose case has been seized on by conservatives, many of whom wore pins bearing her name during the speech.

“(Laken) Riley, an innocent young woman who was killed by an illegal,” Biden said, as he called on Republicans to pass a bipartisan border deal. Note: Jose Ibarra, a Venezuelan who police say crossed the border illegally, has been accused of the crime but not convicted.

His attempt to triangulate toward Republicans on their signature border issue is turning off some Democrats.

“The rhetoric President Biden used tonight was dangerously close to language from Donald Trump that puts a target on the backs of Latinos everywhere,” the Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro from Texas said on X.

Biden’s own administration made a show of officially ending use of the term “illegal alien” in US immigration enforcement agencies’ official communications.

What to make of a hot-mic moment
After the speech, on the House floor, when Biden thought he could not be heard by microphones, he was approached by Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who asked him to keep pressing Israel on allowing humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Biden said he would have a “come to Jesus meeting” with Bibi, the nickname for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, an incredible way to phrase any kind of meeting with the leader of the Jewish state. Plus, while that kind of candor might be exactly the sentiment a lot of Democrats concerned about Palestinians want to hear about Israel, it’s much further than Biden is willing to go in public.

Speaking to reporters at Joint Base Andrews, Biden declined to elaborate on the hot-mic moment.

“I didn’t say that in the speech,” he said, adding: “You guys (are) eavesdropping on things.”

Biden’s desire to maintain some discipline around a public message is a contrast with Trump, who thrives on saying shocking things in public, be it at a campaign rally or from outside a courtroom.

The puzzle Biden and his campaign must solve is how to maintain momentum from a speech that will mostly be forgotten in the coming weeks.",3/10/2024,Zachary B.

"Jim Crow 2.0: As US elections near, new efforts to suppress Black votes
",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/12/jim-crow-2-0-as-us-elections-near-new-efforts-to-suppress-black-votes,"In the days and months leading up to today’s presidential primary in Georgia, activists have been on the ground in African American neighborhoods across the state working to prevent a rollback of voter rights that they say harkens back to the Jim Crow era.

After record voter turnout flipped the state from deep red to barely blue in the 2020 presidential elections, Georgia has become the epicentre of a GOP campaign to effectively deny African Americans’ access to the ballot box in the American South.
Georgia’s Republican legislators passed a melange of laws in 2021 intended to restrict voting in the state, strengthening voter identification requirements for absentee balloting, reducing the availability of drop boxes, and expanding the legislature’s authority in elections. Mirroring arguments made by GOP operatives nationwide, Republicans in Georgia contend that the measures are necessary to combat voter fraud. But Democrats and voting rights experts have countered that there is no statistical evidence of widespread voter fraud anywhere in the country, and that the reforms target African Americans who overwhelmingly support Democratic candidates and can therefore determine the outcome of elections when they turn out in large numbers, as was the case in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election.

Cliff Albright, co-founder of Black Voters Matter and executive director of the Black Voters Matter Fund, said that Republican lawmakers across a wide swath of the former Confederacy have been redrawing the borders of election districts to favour their own party (often called “gerrymandering”), purging voters from the rolls and rewriting laws to effectively disenfranchise African Americans. Alabama’s House of Representatives last week approved legislation that would make it a felony for anyone in the state to receive help in filling out an absentee ballot from anyone who has not been designated by elections officials or is not a relative, or co-inhabitant.

Under the proposal, anyone convicted of the crime could be sentenced to as many as 20 years in prison, on par with sentencing guidelines for manslaughter and statutory rape.

And the Republican-controlled Mississippi legislature has repeatedly refused to repeal a Draconian provision in the state constitution, written in 1890, that disenfranchises anyone convicted of a catalogue of crimes that includes car theft, robbery, perjury and receiving stolen goods.

White backlash
Legal scholars and advocates have said that this wave of voter suppression is not isolated, but rather part of a broader white backlash that is animated, in large measure, by growing economic woes, and the feeling that people of colour – African Americans especially – are gaining ground and may soon surpass whites in terms of social status and economic prosperity. In this way, many academics have said, renewed efforts to suppress the Black vote are related to the mostly white rioters who stormed the US Capitol on January 6th, 2021 in an effort to overturn the presidential election, and the litany of young, white gunmen who have waged racially motivated attacks in recent years on African American parishioners and shoppers.

A peer-reviewed study published by the Brennan Center for Justice in 2022 found that the US is amid “an unprecedented wave of anti-voter legislation introduced and passed across the country.” Continuing the report’s author wrote, “In 2021, at least one bill with a provision restricting access to voting was introduced in the legislature of every state except Vermont. By early May of this year, nearly 400 restrictive bills had been introduced in legislatures nationwide,” representing a nearly seven-fold increase over 2020.

“There is a true backlash towards Black and brown folks” Melanie Campbell, president and CEO of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation told Al Jazeera. “That makes it [this election year] very different … It’s a very toxic environment.”

‘Gaza will hurt if they don’t change course.’
Campbell and Albright said that their organisations have mounted massive “ground games” to offset the campaign of voter suppression, going door to door to educate and register voters, staffing phone banks, sending text messages and even touring Black neighbourhoods in the South by bus to shine a spotlight on the wide range of material deficits on the ground.
Scholars have said that suppressing the African American vote, however, is not a bug but a feature of US democracy, dating back to the era known as Jim Crow. Mobs who set upon African American neighbourhoods in Atlanta in 1906, for example, did so as part of a campaign strategy devised by a gubernatorial candidate. The Atlanta riot was, in fact, informed by one in Wilmington, North Carolina eight years earlier when Democratic party operatives organised a coup to overthrow a populist political party that enjoyed broad support from Black male voters.

Similarly, the GOP’s efforts today are motivated by political gain, Albright said, although he acknowledged that the Democratic party’s leadership can at times be its own worst enemy. Speaking of Black activists working to turn out the Black vote, he told Al Jazeera:

“We get almost zero resources [from the Democratic National Committee]. They’ve got their favourite groups and white, male consultants. And Black groups end up contracting the same white consultants.”

Moreover, he said that the GOP’s efforts to suppress the Black vote is only a part of the Democrats’ problems.

“Young people don’t have much confidence with [Biden].”

And noting the 100,000 Michigan voters who chose the “uncommitted” option in last month’s primary to protest Biden’s failure to stop Israel’s siege and blockade of the Gaza Strip and, increasingly, the West Bank, Campbell said of the Biden campaign:

The outcome of contests across Georgia, Mississippi, and Washington State was never in doubt. Neither Biden, a Democrat, nor Trump, a Republican, faced major opposition. But the magnitude of their wins gave each man the delegate majority he needed to claim his party's nomination at the summertime national conventions.

At 81, Biden is the oldest president in US history, while the 77-year-old Trump is facing decades in prison as a defendant in four criminal cases. Their rematch – the first featuring two US presidents since 1912 – will almost certainly deepen the nation's searing political and cultural divides over the eight-month grind that lies ahead.

In a statement, Biden celebrated the nomination while casting Trump as a serious threat to democracy. Trump, Biden said, ""is running a campaign of resentment, revenge, and retribution that threatens the very idea of America."" He continued, ""I am honored that the broad coalition of voters representing the rich diversity of the Democratic Party across the country have put their faith in me once again to lead our party – and our country – in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever.""

On the eve of Tuesday's primaries, Trump acknowledged that Biden would be the Democratic nominee. ""I assume he's going to be the candidate,"" Trump said of Biden on CNBC. ""I'm his only opponent other than life, life itself.""

Both candidates dominated Tuesday's primaries in swing-state Georgia, deep-red Mississippi and Democratic-leaning Washington. Voting was taking place later in Hawaii's Republican caucus.

91 felony counts
Despite their tough talk, the road ahead will not be easy for either presumptive nominee. Trump is facing 91 felony counts in four criminal cases involving his handling of classified documents and his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, among other alleged crimes. He's also facing increasingly pointed questions about his policy plans and relationships with some of the world's most dangerous dictators. Trump met privately on Friday with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who has rolled back democracy in his country.

Biden, who would be 86 years old at the end of his next term, is working to assure a skeptical electorate that he's still physically and mentally able to thrive in the world's most important job. Voters in both parties are unhappy with his handling of immigration and inflation. And he's dealing with additional dissension within his party's progressive base, furious that he hasn't done more to stop Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.

"Biden, Trump set for US election rematch after clinching party nominations",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/13/biden-trump-set-for-us-election-rematch-after-clinching-party-nominations,"Expected wins at Georgia, Mississippi and Washington give each contender the delegate count needed to claim nomination at party convention.
United States President Joe Biden and his predecessor, Donald Trump, are set for an election rematch in November after clinching their respective parties’ nominations.

Primary elections in Georgia, Mississippi and Washington on Tuesday handed Biden the Democratic nomination and Trump the nod from the Republican Party.
Biden, who had no serious competition in his party, reached the required 1,968-delegate threshold to be nominated while Trump, whose last rival Nikki Haley withdrew from the race last week, also passed the mark of 1,215 delegates needed. Both will be officially nominated at their parties’ conventions in August and July, respectively.

The widely expected results set up the first US presidential election rematch in nearly 70 years, as well as a contest between two candidates that opinion polls suggest that many voters do not want.

At 81, Biden is already the oldest president in US history, while the 77-year-old Trump is facing 91 felony counts in four criminal cases, involving his handling of classified documents and his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, among other alleged crimes.

Their rematch will almost certainly deepen the country’s political and cultural divides over the eight-month grind that lies ahead until the November 5 election.

In a statement, Biden celebrated the nomination while casting Trump as a serious threat to democracy, accusing him of “running a campaign of resentment, revenge, and retribution that threatens the very idea of America”.

Trump, in a video posted on social media, celebrated what he called “a great day of victory”.

“But now we have to get back to work because we have the worst president in the history of our country,” Trump said of Biden. “So, we’re not going to take time to celebrate. We’ll celebrate in eight months when the election is over.”

Brendon O’Connor, a professor at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney, said it was “remarkable” that the Republican Party put Trump forward for a third election in a row after losing the last contest to Biden in 2019.

“Usually, that’s a sign that you should look for a new candidate,” O’Connor told Al Jazeera.

“I think that [Trump] brings fear to his colleagues [in the Republican Party], challenging him is very hard because of his bullying, name-calling way. His supporters are incredibly loyal and vicious against those who challenge Trump within the party,” he said.

In terms of Biden, O’Connor noted that the history of US elections shows that that an incumbent president would not be challenged if they decided to run again for the presidency.

“Once you’ve won a presidential election once, you’d want to win it twice and be a two-term president. That’s usually a mark of success. So, Biden, despite being 81 years old, I think would want that place in the history,” he said.

Biden, who would be 86 years old at the end of his next term, is working to assure a sceptical electorate that he’s still physically and mentally able to thrive in the job.

He is also dealing with additional dissension within his party’s progressive base, furious that he has not done more to stop Israel’s war on Gaza.

"Biden pledges billions to rebuild cities ‘torn apart’ by highways decades ago
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/13/biden-infrastructure-spending-cities,"Joe Biden hailed the beginning of $3.3bn in infrastructure spending on US projects on Wednesday “to right historic wrongs” with efforts to reconnect city neighborhoods riven by interstate highways that plowed with particular impunity through many Black, brown, Asian American and Hispanic communities decades ago.

The US president was in Milwaukee, where he traveled to announce new infrastructure investment and officially open his election campaign’s Wisconsin office in the vital swing state.

Democratic party campaigns in Wisconsin are typically run from the state capital, Madison, whereas the Biden re-election campaign has picked Milwaukee, the more industrial and diverse city on Lake Michigan, where 40% of residents are Black. The Republicans will hold their convention in Milwaukee in July.

Biden is striving to make an impact on the campaign trail in a number of swing states this week after his fiery State of the Union speech last week.

He travels to Michigan on Thursday, part of the “blue wall”, along with Pennsylvania, where Biden was born and has made more campaign trips than any other state.

Donald Trump flipped all three states to win the White House in 2016, but Biden took them back four years ago and almost certainly needs to hold them if he is to secure a second term.

Biden slightly behind Trump but voters’ views of economy improve, poll shows

Biden and Trump unofficially clinched their parties’ respective nominations on Tuesday night after more primary wins, and expect to be officially anointed at their party conventions this summer.

The rare presidential election rematch, the first since 1956, comes while Trump is due in court later this month for the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president, with more to come as he faces 91 criminal charges across four cases at federal and state levels.

On Wednesday, the White House declared that $3.3bn in federal funding is being allocated in more than 40 states, originating from the Biden administration’s 2021 infrastructure legislation, to help areas “divided by transportation infrastructure decades ago and [that] have long been overlooked”.

Biden announced a $36.6m federal grant on his Milwaukee visit to upgrade sidewalks and create cycle lanes, greater access to mass transit and more greenery in the South 6th Street area of Bronzeville, a historic majority African American neighborhood.

Biden said the construction of interstate highways there led to the demolition of roughly 17,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, disproportionately impacting Black and poor neighborhoods in the 1960s, with a losses of prosperity and opportunities “that still reverberate today”.

He pledged “to right historic wrongs and, in the process, deliver environmental justice to disadvantaged neighborhoods”.

The US transportation department estimates that at least a million people and businesses in the US were displaced by decades of harmful urban renewal projects in the buildout of the federal highway system, a statement from the White House said.

Biden said: “The story of Bronzeville here in Milwaukee is one we see all across the country. Our interstate highway system laid out in the 1950s was a groundbreaking connection of our nation, coast to coast … but instead of connecting communities, it divided them.”

He added: “These highways actually tore them apart … along with redlining, they disconnected entire communities from opportunities, sometimes, in an effort to reinforce segregation.”

Biden also took a jab directly at Trump’s conduct in dealing with the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, when he was president.

“My predecessor failed at the most basic duty any president owes the American people – the duty to care,” he said.

"Biden slightly behind Trump but voters’ views of economy improve, poll shows
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/13/biden-trump-economy-poll,"Joe Biden officially begins his general election campaign with a slight polling deficit against Donald Trump, and no indications that his forceful State of the Union address has provided much of a boost with voters, according to a public opinion survey released on Wednesday.

But the newly released USA Today/Suffolk University poll also shows views of the economy have hit their highest level of Biden’s presidency, a sign that voters may be starting to agree with the president that his policies helped the country recover from the Covid-19 pandemic.

Biden and Trump on Tuesday clinched the final delegates they needed to win the Democratic and Republican nominations, respectively, with primary victories in Washington state, Mississippi and Georgia. They will be officially named the nominees at their party’s conventions over the summer, but by all indications, Americans are not looking forward to the first rematch between presidential candidates in almost seven decades.

Polls have repeatedly shown both men are unpopular with voters, but the USA Today/Suffolk University survey finds Trump has a slight advantage over Biden nationally, with 40% of voters preferring him over the president’s 38%.

And while unfavorability ratings for both men are 55%, the poll finds Republicans are more fired up about a second Trump presidency than Democrats are for another four years of Biden. Forty-three per cent of Republicans say they are “excited” about Trump’s nomination, versus 22% of Democrats about Biden.

Biden’s approval ratings have been underwater for more than two and a half years, and the dip roughly coincided with the intensification of inflation that accompanied the economy’s bounceback from the mass layoffs and business closures caused by Covid-19.

While the White House has tried to redirect voters’ attention to the strong labor market, ebbing rate of price growth and the potential offered by Biden’s legislative accomplishment, views of the economy specifically have remained negative.

But the USA Today/Suffolk University poll shows that voters are becoming less pessimistic. A third of registered voters believe the economy is recovering, the highest share saying that since Biden took office, the survey says.

“This data point is particularly important to track. If the trend continues, more voters could connect the economic recovery to President Biden, especially if the economy continues to dominate other issues as we get closer to November,” David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, said.
Democrats were also cheered by Biden’s performance at the annual State of the Union address last week. The president laid into Trump in a passionate speech that, for some of his allies, quieted fears about the 81-year-old Biden being too old to campaign effectively.

But it didn’t do much to move the needle among the poll’s respondents.

Both men captured nearly all the votes cast so far in what had become token state primaries, along with the primary for Democrats abroad and the Republican caucus in Hawaii. Biden also won the Northern Mariana Islands primary on Tuesday morning, earning 11 delegates.
In Georgia, a nascent effort to register opposition to the Biden administration’s support for the war in Gaza could not be easily expressed with “no preference” protest votes in that state, because the ballot does not provide a way to do so.

“I voted a protest vote against the war in Gaza because I think it is horrible what is happening and I’m ashamed of my country right now,” said Robin Hawking, 56, a software developer. She said she is normally a Republican voter. “I’m hoping if enough people vote for not-Biden, he’ll get the message that he’s going to lose this election unless he does a ceasefire.”

Uchenna Nwosu, a gynecologist, said her decision was a no-brainer.

“It’s clear that I couldn’t vote for somebody who repealed women’s rights for abortion, for instance, for healthcare,” she said. “I don’t know why Trump should be in the race. I mean, that alone is a good reason. He doesn’t stand for anything that I stand for. So that’s it.”

Trump ran unopposed in Georgia, though other names still appeared on the ballot, attracting a few voters.

Scott Carpenter of Roswell voted for former ambassador Nikki Haley because he hated Trump, he said. He voted for Biden in 2020. “I don’t like Trump. I don’t like Biden. I just wanted a different choice,” he said.

Travis Foreman, 46, an attorney in Alpharetta, said he thought Trump was good for America and expressed frustration with the Democratic party.

“I don’t agree with the party and some of their core beliefs,” Foreman said, adding that he’s voted Democratic and independent during his life. “And it’s hard for me as a preacher’s kid from south Georgia to just agree with some of their core fundamental beliefs that they want me to. A whole gender ideology, movement – I just have a problem with it. I don’t mind what anyone chooses to do with their lives and how they live their lives, but don’t try to force me to accept certain things against my own principles. It just came to me that’s the No 1 issue.”
Biden won enough delegates in Georgia almost immediately to win the Democratic nomination, which requires 1,968 on the first ballot to win.

“Four years ago, I ran for president because I believed we were in a battle for the soul of this nation. Because of the American people, we won that battle, and now I am honored that the broad coalition of voters representing the rich diversity of the Democratic party across the country have put their faith in me once again to lead our party – and our country – in a moment when the threat Trump poses is greater than ever,” he said in a statement.",3/13/2024,George Chidi ,The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Washington state""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Dean Phillips""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Gaza""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Robin Hawking""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Nikki Haley""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Scott Carpenter""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Roswell""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Mississippi""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Northern Mariana Islands""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Hawaii""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""primary elections""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Biden administration""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Uchenna Nwosu""}]",0.59
"Vote against Trump, former supporters urge in $50m video campaign
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/13/republicans-against-trump-video-ad,"An anti-Donald Trump group of Republicans is launching its second campaign against the former president, spending $50m and using testimonials from former supporters in an attempt to convince voters to turn away from Trump.

This week, Republican Voters Against Trump released 100 videos recorded by anti-Trump Republicans explaining why they no longer support him.

Sarah Longwell, president of Republican Accountability political action committee, which is behind the campaign, explained the logic behind the effort in a press release on Tuesday.
“Traditional Republican voters who have long supported the party but have concerns about Donald Trump proved decisive in the 2020 election. By targeting these voters and reaching them with credible messengers, the campaign will establish a permission structure for them to withhold their support from Trump again,” she said.

“This will help re-create the anti-Trump coalition that made the margin of victory in 2020 and holds the key to 2024.

The group ran the same unconventional ad campaign against Trump in 2020, when it ultimately received over a thousand homemade testimonials on its website.

“One of the reasons they are so compelling is because you can tell how authentic they are, how deeply they feel this – a lot of them want to get something off their chest,” Longwell told the Guardian in 2020.

Longwell told the New York Times in a piece published on Tuesday that she had raised $20m so far for 2024 and hoped to raise the rest of the $30m before the election in November. The group has received large donations from anti-Trump billionaires, according to Forbes, including the Democratic donor and co-founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman and John Pritzker, a member of the family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain.

In many of the videos, former supporters say that the January 6 Capitol insurrection turned them against Trump.

“January 6 was the end of Donald Trump for me. I could not believe what was happening before my eyes – watching what was an insurrection at the Capitol, which was, in my mind, unquestionably led by Donald Trump,” Ethan, a former Trump supporter from Wisconsin, said in one video.

Chuck, a supporter from Nebraska, similarly said that he “completely 100% hold[s] him accountable for the insurrection”.
“I will vote Democrat. I can’t believe I’m saying it. But I will not ever support or vote for Donald Trump ever. I’ll vote for Joe Biden,” Chuck said.

Many other supporters similarly express disbelief at Trump’s popularity with the Republican party, often saying that Biden is the first Democrat they have ever supported.

“Now, I understand that a lot of people say, ‘Oh, well look at maybe Joe Biden in his past,’ and you hear that ‘Oh, everyone’s corrupt and has got a torrid past,’” said Paul, a voter in North Carolina, in his testimonial. “Maybe Joe Biden does, something he lied about many years ago about his record, but he’s not even in the same league as Trump as far as all the different lies.”

Longwell said in the release this week that she believed “former Republicans and Republican-leaning voters hold the key to 2024”.

“Whatever their complaints about Joe Biden – Donald Trump is too dangerous and too unhinged to ever be president again,” she said. “Who better to make this case than the voters who used to support him?”

"Georgia Democrats brace for a 'tough fight ahead' in keeping the state blue in 2024
",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/georgia-democrats-tough-fight-biden-trump-rcna142748,"ATLANTA — Georgia was the site of Democrats’ biggest breakthrough in the 2020 election, with Joe Biden becoming the party’s first presidential nominee to win the state in 28 years. 

But four years later, some of the organizers who helped orchestrate the history-making victory acknowledge Democrats face an uphill climb to keep the state blue as they prepare for a rematch with Donald Trump. 

“This is certainly not going to be a walk in the park,” said LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of the voting rights group Black Voters Matter. “I think that we certainly have a tough fight ahead of us.”

Brown is among the activists credited with helping turn out Black and younger voters, who helped carry Biden to victory in the state in 2020.

But she said the mood is much different among those voters this time around, as a sense of fatigue with the political process has set in.

“You get to the tipping point where people really want to see change, and I think the rate of change for things they want to see is not happening as fast as they want to see it,” Brown said.

“It’s sobering to deal with the reality of how slowly change actually happens,” she added. 

In 2020, Biden won Georgia by just 11,779 votes, becoming the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry the state since Bill Clinton in 1992.

Two months after Biden’s victory, Georgia voters sent two more Democrats — Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — to the U.S. Senate in runoff elections, flipping the state’s two seats and control of the Senate from the GOP.

At the time, Georgia was heralded as an example to other local Democratic parties of how to organize and turn out voters in traditionally red states. 

But four years later, early polls suggest Biden has lost significant ground in Georgia. A survey from The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in January showed him trailing Trump by 8 percentage points among registered voters in the state.

The poll also found that Biden’s approval rating was well underwater, including among independents. And 10% of Black voters said they didn't plan to vote in the presidential election.

A CBS News/YouGov poll released this week showed a slightly tighter race, with Trump leading Biden by 3 points among likely voters, within the margin of error.

Ahead of Georgia’s presidential primary election this week, Biden and Trump held competing rallies in the state, underscoring its importance for each campaign’s path to victory.

Georgia is also guaranteed to be in the spotlight for another reason: It is home to one of four criminal cases against Trump, who faces charges in Fulton County alleging he tried to overturn the results of the state’s 2020 presidential election.
And while Democrats acknowledge that the case could prove beneficial in their efforts to turn out voters in Georgia, some strategists point to several missed opportunities for the party to drum up enthusiasm. They include passing over Atlanta as the location for this summer’s Democratic National Convention, opting instead for Chicago.

But Kendra Cotton, CEO of the New Georgia Project Action Fund, an affiliate of the group founded by former gubernatorial candidate and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams, said enthusiasm isn’t the best marker to measure turnout.

“Who cares whether folks are enthusiastic? What you care about is whether or not they’re going to actually get out to vote,” Cotton said. “Because what I can tell you is in the Southern region, rare are the elections where people are super enthusiastic about candidates, but we vote nonetheless.”

Both she and Brown said their approach will be to focus less on the candidate and more on empowering people to know their votes can change their circumstances. Cotton said it has been challenging to inform voters about the Biden administration’s accomplishments, and she urged Biden’s surrogates to tell more personal stories of people who have benefited from his policies.

“We know it’s going to take many more touches, door knocks, to talk to people to ensure that while they may not be as excited about voting for either candidate, they will be resolved, nonetheless, to show up and cast the ballot,” Cotton said.

Republicans say the lack of excitement for Biden has provided them with an opening to reclaim the state in November. 

Martha Zoller, a longtime Georgia Republican strategist, points to Georgia’s 2022 midterms as evidence that that goal is well within reach. Republicans won every nearly statewide race that year, with the notable exception of Trump-endorsed Senate candidate Herschel Walker.

Zoller, who cast an early primary ballot for Nikki Haley, who has dropped out of the presidential race, said the message Trump decides to tour with will be key in winning back the Republican voters who have soured on him — especially those in suburban Atlanta counties like Gwinnett and Cobb, which proved crucial to Biden’s victory.

“You’ve got to get back the people like me that you lost: a suburban woman who voted for Trump twice, gave money to him, but after Jan. 6 just really didn’t want any part of it anymore,” she said.

“The key really is going to be can he be positive enough? It’s tone. It’s looking forward and not backward,” she added. “There are good surrogates throughout the state that can take the message out. And if they can do that, then it’s going to be different, because it’s just 12,000 votes. That is an easy number to overcome, especially if this time the Democrats aren’t as excited about voting for Joe Biden.”

Democrats acknowledge Biden won Georgia under a unique set of circumstances in 2020, between the pandemic and the social unrest fueled by the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd.

But Fred Hicks, a political consultant in Georgia, said the party would ultimately unite around one cause: beating Trump.

“Donald Trump is the best tool that Democrats have in our arsenal to win 2024,” Hicks said. “As long as Donald Trump is on the ballot in Georgia, Democrats have a chance.”",3/13/2024,Blayne Alexander,NBC News,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Raphael Warnock""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""ATLANTA""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""U.S. Senate""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""GOP""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Black Voters Matter""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""runoff elections""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""LaTosha Brown""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Jon Ossoff""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""The Atlanta Journal-Constitution""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Bill Clinton""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democratic""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020 election""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}]",0.61
"Biden-Trump sequel underway in history-making first presidential election rematch since 1956
",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-trump-sequel-set-first-presidential-election-rematch-since-1956-gets-underway,"Minutes after they clinched the Democratic and Republican presidential nominations, President Biden and former President Donald Trump took aim at each other as their 2024 general election rematch fired up.

""Donald Trump is running a campaign of resentment, revenge, and retribution that threatens the very idea of America,"" Biden argued in a statement as he targeted his Republican challenger.

And Trump, blasting his Democratic predecessor in the White House, charged in a social media post that Biden was ""the Worst, Most Incompetent, Corrupt, and Destructive President in the History of the United States.""

The 2024 rematch – which polls indicate most Americans are anything but enthused about – is now underway.

GAME ON: TRUMP, BIDEN, CLINCH 2024 MAJOR PARTY PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATIONS

Biden clinches 2024 Democratic presidential nominationVideo
And the general election campaign started earlier than at any point in 20 years - when then-Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts locked up the 2004 Democratic nomination in early March and faced Republican President George W. Bush.

The November showdown between Biden and Trump is the first rematch in the race for the White House since 1956, when Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower defeated former Democratic Gov. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois as they faced off a second time.

WHERE THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION RACES STAND

Trump is aiming to become only the second president to serve two non-consecutive terms. That hasn't been accomplished in over 130 years, since Grover Cleveland, who won the White House in 1884 but lost re-election four years later, won back the presidency in 1892.

With over seven and a half months to go until Election Day on November 5, Trump enjoys the early edge in public opinion polling – both in most national surveys and in many of the polls in five of the six key battleground states where Biden narrowly topped Trump to win the White House in 2020.

But in another key metric – fundraising – Biden currently enjoys the upper hand.

The Biden-Trump rematch offers up stark contrasts when it comes to their style and demeanor, and on where they stand on key issues, such as the economy, health care and entitlements, immigration, abortion, foreign policy, the war in Ukraine, and America's overseas role going forward.

The 81-year-old Biden, who four years ago made history as the oldest American ever elected president, will continue to face questions about his mental and physical durability, even after last week's vigorous State of the Union address.

The president also needs to show that he can energize younger voters, progressives, and Black and Latino Americans, who are all key parts of the Democratic base. Biden is also facing primary ballot box protests - materializing in ""uncommitted"" votes - over his support for Israel in its war in Gaza against Hamas.


The former president is also dealing with plenty of problems. 

Trump, who last year made history as the first president or former president to face criminal charges, now faces four major trials and a total of 91 indictments – including federal cases on his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and on handling classified documents. There's also a $355 million civil fraud judgment that Trump is appealing. He will have to juggle his appearances in court with his time on the campaign trail. 

The 77-year-old Trump will also need to court the sizable block of Republican voters who backed Nikki Haley in the GOP nomination race. The former U.N. ambassador and former South Carolina governor was Trump's last remaining rival before ending her White House campaign last week. Haley's support is shining a spotlight on Trump's weakness with suburban and highly educated voters.

Complicating matters further – the presidential rematch between Biden and Trump won't be a two-candidate race.

Democratic-turned-Independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is working to place his name on state ballots across the country. Kennedy, a longtime environmental activist and high-profile vaccine skeptic who's a scion of the famous Kennedy political dynasty, is grabbing double-digits in many general election polls.

Green Party candidate Jill Stein and progressive independent candidate Cornell West are polling in the single digits. And the centrist group No Labels is moving ahead with plans to launch a third party ""unity"" presidential ticket.

While third party and independent candidates didn't play much of a role in the 2020 presidential election, they did in the 2016 showdown between Trump and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.

"Delays and counterattacks: How the Trump campaign plans to use his court dates for political gain
",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-campaign-court-dates-political-gain-rcna142804,"Donald Trump’s campaign is engineering a plan to “make lemonade out of lemons” as a full docket of court appearances are about to swamp his political calendar.

The strategy, the former president's advisers tell NBC News, will involve trying to portray President Joe Biden as someone attempting to “imprison” his political opponents, muddying the waters between Trump’s and Biden’s legal problems, creating counterprogramming events focused on policy and ultimately pushing to delay the trials for as long as possible. 

The unprecedented task of a presidential candidate simultaneously swaying courts of law and public opinion has long loomed in the background. Trump turned his legal travails into primary gold, but repeating that feat in a general election — where swing voters matter — is more challenging.  

The first criminal trial is set to begin March 25, when a Manhattan jury will consider charges that Trump falsified business records to cover up hush money payments to an adult film star during his 2016 campaign. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, however, said Thursday he doesn't oppose delaying the start of the trial for 30 days.
Along with the obvious legal pitfalls, the trial will have Trump in courtrooms almost all day at least four days a week as the general election kicks off — a trial that could last eight weeks. It means Trump will, at times, be running for president functionally on a part-time basis, unable to do things such as regularly hold live campaign events or fundraising.

Trump’s criminal legal woes — which include dozens of separate charges across four separate indictments — served as political rocket fuel during the GOP primary among base voters who almost universally, though without evidence, viewed the issue through the lens of Biden using the justice system to go after his top political rival. 

When entering the general election, however, the politics of Trump’s legal predicaments become increasingly murky.

And his team knows it. 

“Indictments are not ideal, we would rather the boss not be in court,” a top Trump adviser said. “But there will be an attempt to make lemonade out of lemons here.”

Another acknowledged that it “clearly presents a scheduling conflict,” but added, “We will work through it.” 

On weekends between trial days, Trump is expected to be doing more policy-focused events, drawing contrasts between his proposals and Biden’s record. The events will be held in specific communities affected by whatever specific policy is being highlighted that day. In addition, on Wednesdays — the one weekday without a court date — Trump is expected to focus on fundraising.

At this point in the campaign, as opposed to the stretch after Labor Day, Trump’s schedule wouldn’t be packed with rallies. But the court dates are likely to lighten his political calendar as long as he is on trial.

To try to fill Trump’s vacuum, the team plans to deploy more top-level campaign surrogates to “have a voice outside of New York City press conferences,” and increase attacks on Biden over issues such as immigration, his mental fitness, crime and the economy, according to one of the Trump advisers. 

They will also place a heavy focus on trying to counter attacks from his political foes that a second Trump term would usher a wannabe dictator into the White House.

“They [Democrats] are going to try and make the campaign about abortion and that we are a threat to democracy,” the Trump adviser said. “Hard to say we are a threat to democracy when you are trying to imprison political opponents.”

Matthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist, said it’s difficult to project the effect of Trump’s trials on the election because “an unprecedented part of American history is now colliding with the unpredictability of electoral politics.”

We do not even really need to win the argument, we just have to neutralize it.

TRUMP ADVISER

“There are serious charges but it is unclear if the American public can right now distinguish each individual case or even the critical details,” he said.

The hush money case in New York is scheduled to be the first Trump indictment to go to trial, but others will likely tether the former president to courtrooms throughout the general election calendar.

He has also been charged in a Florida federal court over his handling of classified documents after his presidency, a case in which prosecutors have requested a trial this calendar year but the judge has not yet set a date after agreeing to delay the original May start time.

He faces another federal trial in Washington, D.C., for charges related to his effort to overturn the 2020 election. That case is on hold while the Supreme Court considers Trump’s claim that he is immune from criminal charges for his actions while he was president. If the high court allows the case to move forward, it could mean Trump’s highest-profile trial will come in the last sprint to Election Day.

Finally, Trump faces separate charges in Georgia over efforts by him and his allies to overturn the state’s 2020 election results. That case has a proposed Aug. 5 trial date, but delays are expected. The judge in that case is currently weighing whether to disqualify prosecutor Fani Willis over alleged misconduct relating to her relationship with a subordinate.

Procedural delays are also a key part of Trump’s legal strategy. 

“What if none of this stuff is heard or settled before the election?” a Trump supporter said. “I mean, what then? What are we talking about here?”

The stunning nature of a former and potentially future president being charged with trying to thwart the smooth transition of power has been the main focus of Democrats, but is also central to the Trump campaign’s strategy while their candidate is stuck in court.

Advisers believe that if they amplify attacks on Biden that attempt to create an equivalency between Trump’s legal problems and Biden’s, they can effectively muddy the water with voters and in the process make the legal issues — including those related to election interference — a less significant issue.

“We do not even really need to win the argument, we just have to neutralize it,” another Trump adviser said. “If we do, the decision-making calculus favors us.”

Key to that strategy will be the report issued by special counsel Robert Hur, a former Trump-era Justice Department official who was appointed last year by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate Biden’s handling of classified documents after his time as vice president. 

Hur did not charge Biden, but his report left plenty of ammunition for the president’s political detractors. 

In the report released last month, Hur wrote that he wasn’t recommending charges against Biden, in part, because a jury would find him to be a “sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory,” a description Democrats said was overt partisan politics, while Republicans used it to continue to build a narrative that Biden is in mental decline. The transcript of Hur’s interview was more nuanced, showing the president stumbling over some facts but recalling others clearly.

The Hur report offers the Trump campaign a one-two punch. 

It allows his aides to hit on both his mental acuity, and the idea that there is a weaponized justice system. A key difference in the classified documents case is that Biden cooperated with investigators when it was discovered that he may have retained classified documents, while Trump did not. Still, Republicans say the fact that Biden was not charged and that Trump is facing 37 criminal counts after it was discovered is further evidence of a two-tiered justice system.

“It’s the sort of stuff that can really help us flip the script on this stuff,” the Trump adviser said. “It’s something people will be hearing a lot more about.”

Rob Godfrey, a South Carolina-based Republican strategist, said the value of Trump’s weaponization of government argument is more effective with GOP base voters than it is with persuadable voters in a general election, something backed up by polling data. 

As of February, 21% of Republicans believe Trump “committed serious federal crimes,” a number that jumps to 57% for independent voters, according to a New York Times/Siena tracking poll. NBC News polling in February also found that Trump’s standing would be hurt by a felony conviction. Trump was leading Biden 47%-42% overall, but Biden took a narrow 45%-43% lead when respondents were asked how they feel about Trump if he were convicted of a felony. 

It’s the reason, Godfrey says, Trump’s messaging needs to be two-pronged.

“Let the court cases continue to keep the base supporters solidified behind him, because it’s obviously a motivator for them,” he said. “But when it comes to independent voters, when it comes to softer Republican voters, it’s an open question of how much of a motivator the court cases are.”

“So what the Trump campaign and its allies should do,” Godfrey added, “is make sure those folks are focused on policy differences between the two candidates.”",3/14/2024,Matt Dixon and Jonathan Allen,NBC News,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Manhattan""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""counterprogramming events""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Alvin Bragg""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""court appearances""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""criminal trial""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""GOP primary""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""swing voters""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""campaign events""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""general election""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""NBC News""}]",0.42

Taken as a whole, the surveys are significant due to Biden’s 2020 victories in all eight of the states now considered 2024 battlegrounds.

The most recent polling in each state depicts Trump’s dramatic lead:

Eight: Virginia

Trump’s polling lead over Biden is due to the ongoing political realignment upending Biden’s 2024 intersectional coalition, Republican insiders told Breitbart News. “The swing states needed to win the White House are all coming back to Trump,” Republican strategist Garrett Ventry told Breitbart News. “He is building a winning diverse coalition of working-class voters and minority voters.”

“It’s simple: they know Joe Biden’s policies harmed them, and Donald Trump’s policies helped them,” he added.

Democrat inroads with black, Latino, and Asian voters deteriorated to the lowest point in 60 years, polling from Gallup and Siena College recently revealed. Hispanic and black men could vote for Trump in proportions not seen in American politics since the 1950s.

“Biden’s disastrous open border, out-of-control crime, crippling inflation, and third-world lawfare against his political rival is catapulting Trump back into the White House,” said Mike Davis, founder and president of the pro-Trump Article III Project.

The non-white identification with Democrats is “at its lowest since the 1960s, before the civil rights movement and the 1964 election which aligned Black voters with the Dems and against the GOP,” Financial Times columnist and chief data reporter John Burn-Murdoch explained on X.

The political realignment is also among class and income demographics. “In 2020 the richest third of voters favoured the Dems for the first time, and the Republicans improved with the poorest,” Burn-Murdoch wrote. “The GOP now appeals to working- and middle-class voters of all ethnicities.”

Karoline Leavitt, the national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said Biden’s deteriorating support is due to his far-left policies that do not resonate with independents.

“There are more than 100 polls showing President Trump crushing Joe Biden, including recent polling that has him leading in every key battleground state and winning independents by double digits,” Leavitt said.

“Joe Biden no longer has a base as key Democrat constituencies such as African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and women are supporting President Trump because they are sick and tired of Crooked Joe’s record-high inflation, open borders, crime and chaos,” she added.

Trump appeared to spur the realignment in 2016, forcing the Republican Party to identify with working-class citizens instead of college-educated, upper-income, and big business voters, according to Patrick Ruffini, the cofounder of Echelon Insights.

“Trump may have perfectly embodied this old Republican stereotype, but under his watch, the party now has more people in it on the bottom half of the economic ladder, without college diplomas,” Ruffini explained in Time. “This is a net positive for the GOP’s ability to win elections in the future, given that more than 6 in 10 voters don’t have a college degree.”

“But what’s different in 2024 is an election playing out under an umbrella of economic anxiety,” he continued. “And that’s pushing more working class voters into Trump’s camp—especially nonwhite voters commonly aligned with the Democratic Party.",3/14/2024,Wendell Husebo,BREITBART,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Wisconsin""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Nevada""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Fox News""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Garrett Ventry""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Florida Atlantic University""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Breitbart""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Siena College""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""YouGov""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Randy Clark""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Minnesota""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Gallup""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Arizona""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Michigan""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Pennsylvania""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Mike Davis""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Article III Project""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""swing states""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Emerson College""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Virginia""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden is due to the ongoing political realignment upending Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Breitbart News""}]",0.44
"Biden aims to prove he can still stump the old way as his last campaign kicks into gear
",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/14/politics/biden-campaign-swing-states/index.html,"President Joe Biden’s weeklong tour of swing states is aimed to prove he can still stump the old way for his last campaign in a long life of politics, a state-by-state argument to convince voters that he remains the best man for the job.

Across five electoral battlegrounds this week, Biden addressed his supporters from a high school gym, an industrial event space, an indoor tennis court, a Boys-and-Girls Club and a supporter’s front porch, hoping to put an exclamation point on his impassioned State of the Union address last week.

It was a far cry from the same period four years ago when Biden was forced to dramatically scale back his campaign as the Covid-19 pandemic took hold, including long stretches cloistered at his Delaware home.

LuVerda Martin, a nurse and midwife from the Milwaukee suburbs, acknowledged that she’s had lingering questions about the wisdom of Biden running again. But she said she was “pleasantly surprised” by the president’s performance and rationale for four more years.

“I was actually quite motivated by what I saw,” Martin said in an interview on the eve of Biden’s stop in Wisconsin. “I felt relieved with the talking points and how he expressed himself, and his energy level was quite impressive.”

From the corridors of the West Wing to campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, advisers to the president were exuberant about the opening volley of the general election. Yet it’s an open question whether Biden’s performance will move public sentiment and his approval ratings, which have been alarmingly low for a president seeking reelection.

“I just don’t think he gets credit simply because he’s not as loud and boisterous about what he is doing,” Martin said. “We tend to focus on the negative. We tend to think about what’s not happening.”

As the curtain rises on the general election – a moment Biden’s aides have been anxiously awaiting – the contrast on the campaign trail was stark. Trump’s and Biden’s paths crossed only once as they held events on the same day in Georgia. The rest of the week, Trump was either in a courtroom or doing friendly interviews from his home base in Mar-a-Lago, while Biden was encountering the swing-state voters who will play an outsized role in deciding the November election.

Yet for all of his miles traveled, Biden came face-to-face with a relatively small number of supporters – much less undecided voters. The audiences for his speeches numbered in the hundreds, not thousands, and his invitation-only events were mainly intended for the party faithful and friendly local officials to tout his accomplishments from the first term and his ambitions for a second.

At a YMCA in Goffstown, New Hampshire, Biden worked to sharpen the contrast with Trump on health care, an issue his campaign strongly believes can help woo voters in November. He was assisted in his efforts by an interview Trump gave earlier in the day suggesting he was open to cuts to Medicare and Social Security – a move Biden insisted he was “never going to allow.”

The performance was more sedate than his State of the Union – and far quieter, with his words sometimes difficult to discern in the indoor tennis courts where he was speaking. A protester outside chanting “Let’s Go Brandon” in a bullhorn was faintly audible during his remarks.

That may have not been a surprise for a policy-focused speech, which still received an enthusiastic reception from the mostly retirement-aged audience. But even Biden seemed, toward the end of his address, to recognize the limits of attention span.

“I’m taking too much of your time,” he said. “You’re very gracious.”

2024 is not a total repeat of 2020
For all the talk of a rematch with Trump, the race is hardly shaping up as simply a sequel of the last campaign that was waged under the specter of a global pandemic. The president’s visits to campaign field offices this week were designed to show that his organization is preparing for an entirely different operation in 2024.

“The thing about this campaign – particularly here in Milwaukee, specifically, but Wisconsin generally and several other states – it’s going to get down to knocking on doors, the old-fashioned way,” Biden said as he dropped by a Milwaukee field office, one of 44 set to open across Wisconsin in the coming weeks.

Biden’s campaign plans to dramatically scale up its brick-and-mortal presence in battleground states this month, including opening more than 100 new offices and hiring 350 new team members, who will spend the month training volunteers.

Visiting the front porch of one of his supporters Thursday in Saginaw, Michigan, Biden worked to motivate a crowd of his backers and volunteers, who later participated in a training session on door knocking. The location wasn’t disclosed ahead of time, and Biden couldn’t be heard by reporters while he was addressing the crowd.

Saginaw County is one of the nation’s few true bellwethers, voting for the winner of the last four presidential elections. Support from its large concentration of Black voters will be essential for Biden as his popularity wanes among other parts of his coalition in Michigan, in particular Arab-Americans in the Detroit area angry over his handling of the war in Gaza.

Outside the Saginaw Post Office, many residents said they haven’t yet tuned into the presidential election. Those who have been paying attention expressed mixed sentiments toward the president.

“I think that he’s doing a pretty good job so far,” said Deadra Bond, who voted for Biden in 2020 but remains undecided this year. She said issues like education and the economy were front of mind – and that she would have liked to raise them herself with Biden, if his whereabouts in town Thursday hadn’t been kept a secret.

“I have a problem with that, because I think the people should be able to be there to express our concerns for the city of Saginaw,” she said.

Asked whether she was enthusiastic about Biden running again, Bond paused for a moment before saying “no.”

Rallying the base
This month, advisers say, the president’s first order of business is to excite Democrats and ease any concern about his decision to run. He then will take steps to try and persuade voters who are either torn or exhausted by the Biden-Trump rematch.

Some of those who attended Biden’s events over the past week came away enthused – even as they acknowledged the headwinds he still faces over the coming months.

“I don’t give a damn about his approval ratings,” said Mary Ellis, a resident of Georgia who saw Biden speak at a rally in Atlanta on Saturday. “Not since college years have I felt this passionate – and I graduated from college in ’81 – have I felt this passionate about the plight of our country and where we are. It’s a very serious situation.”

Rashawn Spivey, a Milwaukee plumber who met Biden on a visit to the city late last year, said Trump may hold a broader appeal to rank-and-file voters than many Democrats would like. But he said it was far too early for any panic about the president’s reelection chances.

“Everybody likes to look at the circus of it all, and by the time they make it to the ballot box, they have to get real,” Spivey said in an interview as he kept watch on a project to replace lead pipes across the city with copper ones, courtesy of Biden’s signature bipartisan infrastructure law.

Asked whether that meant voting for Biden, Spivey said: “Yeah, because he’s the most experienced.”

The path ahead crystallizes
As Biden and Trump effectively clinched their respective party nominations by crossing the delegate threshold from the first two months of primary contests, the outlines of the race ahead came into sharper view.

The fight to protect abortion rights hangs over the race in a whole new way, given the Supreme Court’s ruling two years ago that overturned Roe v. Wade. Vice President Kamala Harris, seen by many Democrats as a more natural messenger than Biden on the issue, became the first sitting vice president or president to visit an abortion clinic when she stopped at a Planned Parenthood in Minnesota on Thursday, a dramatic demonstration of her commitment to the issue.

A set of complex policy and political challenges also loom large, particularly the Israel-Hamas war.

While the White House took great care to keep protestors at bay during Biden’s stops this week, the sound of anti-war demonstrations reverberated throughout downtown Milwaukee, where the president spent the night Wednesday.

“We want a permanent ceasefire. We want an end to this non-stop arming of Israel,” said Janan Najeeb, president of the Milwaukee Muslim Women’s Coaliton. “With no change in policy, he will be the reason Democrats lose.”

For Biden, that is both a warning and an opportunity. While he remains staunchly supportive of Israel’s campaign against Hamas, he has begun calling for an “immediate ceasefire” as part of a hostage deal. And one of his top allies in Washington, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, spoke from the Senate floor Thursday to call for new leadership in Israel — a position the White House neither endorsed nor condemned.

Next week, however, it’s back on the trail.

The White House announced the president will make stops in Nevada and Arizona as his general election campaign enters high gear. The monthlong sprint will be capped by a joint appearance with the vice president on March 26 in North Carolina, a state his campaign is trying to turn blue – an insurance policy, of sorts, as the fight to the fall begins in earnest.",3/15/2024, Kevin Liptak and Jeff Zeleny,CNN,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""swing states""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Delaware""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""indoor tennis court""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""LuVerda Martin""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""general election""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""reelection""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Milwaukee""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Boys-and-Girls Club""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""industrial event space""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""high school gym""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""State of the Union""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Wilmington""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""West Wing""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Wisconsin""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}]",0.39
"Michigan Arab and Muslim leaders fuming after second Biden visit this year with no meeting
",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/michigans-arab-muslim-community-fuming-second-biden-visit-year-no-meet-rcna143510,"SAGINAW, Mich. — For the second time this year, President Joe Biden visited Michigan without any in-person meetings with members of its Arab American or Muslim communities as he faces protests at campaign events and at the ballot box over Israel’s military action in Gaza.

According to the Biden campaign, the president on Thursday visited Saginaw, which it called “a diverse city with a plurality Black and large Latino population,” for an organizing meeting. It said Biden would deliver remarks to highlight “the stark contrast between his agenda of lowering costs for Michiganders and Donald Trump’s attacks on working families in the state, including his comments this week promising to cut Medicare and Social Security.”

But Biden’s team kept the location of the stop close as it tries to minimize the chances of protests and interruptions at events over Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war. 

In January and February, officials from the campaign and the White House traveled to Dearborn to meet with some members of the Muslim and Arab American communities, but Biden himself didn’t join on either occasion.

Several leaders of the community also chose not to attend as they continue to press Biden to engage more directly with them, demand an immediate cease-fire in the war and place conditions on further U.S. military aid to Israel.

There were still protests in Saginaw on Thursday as activists from the “Abandon Biden” movement held a news conference in the town’s center, urging him to support a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.

But some organizers say too much violence has already taken place under the Biden administration’s leadership for them to consider re-electing Biden in November.

“I voted for Biden; I had a Biden sign in my front yard, actually. And I am now the co-chair of the Abandon Biden campaign. So is that on me or is that on Joe Biden?” said Khalid Turaani, one of the group’s leaders. “I think Joe Biden’s total failure to address the humanitarian crisis, the genocide that is going on in Gaza, is really a war crime. I mean, it really is a war crime. In a perfect world, I think Joe Biden will be among Benjamin Netanyahu in The Hague.”

In late January, the United Nation’s highest court, the International Court of Justice in The Hague, Netherlands, ordered the Israeli government to take steps to prevent genocide in Gaza but didn’t directly call for a cease-fire in the war or issue a ruling that Israel had committed genocide.

Turaani warned politicians not to underestimate the growing movement across key battleground states like Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania heading into the general election. 

“If you want to bet on brushing off this movement, good luck in November,” Turaani said, adding, “We want to make sure that Joe Biden is going to be a one-term president, and we’ll make sure that his loss will be coupled with a disgrace of the genocide in Gaza.”

While Biden made several stops around Saginaw, senior White House officials met privately with Arab American and Muslim community leaders in Chicago, which has a large Palestinian American population.

A source familiar with the plans said the officials heard community leaders speak openly about their concerns surrounding the war in Gaza, as well as rising Islamophobia in the U.S. The source said not all community members who were invited to the meeting attended.
“There are some Muslim leaders who have been pushing the administration to keep trying with communities, even if the White House keeps getting the cold shoulder at first. They want to see the effort,” said another person familiar with the Arab American and Muslim community’s concerns.

The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment.

It was Biden’s first time back in Michigan since he clinched his party’s 2024 presidential nomination — and since last month’s primary, in which about 13% of voters in the Democratic contest chose the “uncommitted” option, many of them protesting his handling of the Israel-Hamas war. That added up to more than 100,000 voters across the state, raising concerns about Biden’s general election prospects after he beat former President Donald Trump by 154,000 votes in Michigan in 2020.


According to census data, roughly 300,000 people of Middle Eastern and North African descent live in Michigan. Many of those who vote have leaned toward Democrats in the past.

Biden had hoped for a temporary cease-fire by the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which started this week. But the plans didn’t materialize after talks between Hamas and Israel failed to produce a deal.

Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud said no one from the White House reached out ahead of Biden’s visit to Saginaw.

He added that local members of the Arab American and Muslim community care more about seeing policy changes than having additional conversations with Biden’s team. 

“I think the perspective of the community is dialogue for the sake of dialogue is really not meaningful. What we’re looking for is for action, you know, because lip service doesn’t really get you anywhere,” Hammoud said. “We’ve seen now a change of tone where the president recognizes Palestinian suffering, but what we want are actual concrete steps that are taken to reduce that Palestinian suffering.”

He also said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s calls for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s resignation and for new elections in Israel didn’t go far enough.


“What we have known for decades, Senator Schumer has come to realize — that Benjamin Netanyahu is not a partner nor an ally to the American government or to the American people, and it’s time that we did away with this fascist and with this war criminal,” Hammoud said.

Asked whether he’ll actively campaign against Biden heading into the general election if the White House doesn’t hear his concerns, Hammoud sidestepped slightly and said the region doesn’t have until November to resolve the war.

“People around the world wake up each day and what we find is a kill count — how many innocent men, women and children had been killed,” he said. “And so frankly, we don’t have until November. We’re advocating for a change today to help prevent the killing of innocent men, women and children.

"Partisans are equally likely to say the other candidate is ‘too corrupt’
",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/15/biden-trump-corrupt-poll/,"One of the most remarkable findings from Yahoo News’s new poll is not exactly a new one.

Respondents to the poll, conducted by YouGov, were asked whether they thought a set of concerns applied to President Biden or Donald Trump. Was either of the two general-election candidates too extreme on the issues to be president? Too corrupt? Too incompetent? Too dangerous?

These are broad terms, certainly, allowing for those wanting to express distaste for a candidate to make them fit if they wished. But even given that malleability, it is striking that the difference in views of either candidate as “too corrupt” — not just corrupt, but disqualifyingly corrupt — is so modest.

About 4 in 10 respondents said that was true of Trump, while a third of respondents said so of Biden — a single-digit gap, despite a much wider gap in the number of criminal indictments and impeachments applied to the two candidates.

In general, Americans expressed more concern about Trump than Biden, albeit not by wide margins. Respondents were more likely to say that Trump was too extreme, too corrupt and too dangerous. Only on the “too incompetent” question did a larger percentage identify Biden.


Interestingly, those patterns held even when looking at partisan subgroups. Trump was more likely to be viewed as “too extreme” even by his own party than Biden was by his. Biden was more likely to be viewed as “too incompetent” by the opposing party than Trump was by Democrats.

What’s also interesting is how these numbers have shifted over time.

Yahoo and YouGov asked the same questions in May. Then, the gap between Biden and Trump on the “too corrupt” question was in the double digits, while “too incompetent” was in the single digits. Since then, the “corrupt” gap narrowed and the “incompetent” gap widened — thanks largely to shifts among Republicans.


The share of Republicans saying Biden is too corrupt jumped 12 percentage points, unquestionably because of the investigations and impeachment effort from congressional Republicans. That helped close the overall gap between the two candidates, just as the increase in Republicans saying that Biden is “too incompetent” helped expand the overall gap. Among Democrats, there was no change in the percentage saying Biden was too incompetent.

On both “too corrupt” and “too incompetent,” the gap between Biden and Trump shifted by 10 points to Biden’s disadvantage among all respondents.

This has long been an obvious if quiet aim of the Republican effort to target Biden: convince Republicans dubious of Trump’s indictments and actions that Biden isn’t any better. In the new poll, 5 percent of Republicans say Trump is too corrupt to be president. Nearly 7 in 10 say Biden is — about the same as the percentage of Democrats who view Trump as “too corrupt.”",3/15/2024,Philip Bump,Washington Post,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Yahoo News""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""President Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Yahoo""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""criminal indictments""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Americans""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""YouGov""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""impeachments""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Philip Bump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}]",0.4
"Why does Biden keep mentioning January 6? Because Trump won’t stop talking about it
",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/16/politics/biden-trump-january-6/index.html,"The rallies start with a recording of January 6 prisoners singing the national anthem. Campaign staff hand out pre-made “Too Big to Rig” signs to supporters. When the candidate takes the stage, he calls the rioters “people who love our country” and “hostages unfairly imprisoned for long periods of time.”

There is nothing subtle about how central Donald Trump has made January 6, 2021, to his campaign. More than just continuing to feed denialism and conspiracies about the 2020 election, he is constantly distorting the reality of what happened that day, preaching vindication to his base of voters.

In ways big and small – but often overlooked because they have become so commonplace at his events –  the former president glosses over the violence. He promises pardons for the people who committed it.

On this, Trump and President Joe Biden agree: January 6 itself is a central issue of the 2024 campaign and will be even if Trump’s trials on related indictments get delayed past Election Day.

It’s Biden’s campaign aides who have been surprised how much that’s true.

“People know what happened on January 6,” said Mike Donilon, one of Biden’s closest advisers. “I think most of the country is going to say, ‘We don’t embrace political violence. We do embrace democracy. We do embrace the rule of law. We’re not interested in pardoning people who ransacked the Capitol, and we’re going to have a real problem supporting someone who embraces all that.’”

Though Donilon and a few others — including Vice President Kamala Harris, in private conversations to CNN — had been adamant for three years that January 6 would continue reverberating, Biden aides use words like “stunning” to describe the way Trump has not just kept January 6 present, but burrowed ever deeper into conspiracy theories that are embraced in the right-wing echo chamber but push away more mainstream voters.

And while Biden aides in the Wilmington reelection office have been closely monitoring Trump’s rallies, stockpiling clips for future use to likely pair with the many disturbing videos of the mob breaking down the doors and attacking police, they don’t need to go further than keeping an eye on Trump’s Truth Social account.

“My first acts as your next President will be to Close the Border, DRILL, BABY, DRILL, and Free the January 6 Hostages being wrongfully imprisoned!” he wrote.

Some Biden aides say they were shocked that January 6 keeps coming up in every focus group, to the point that Democratic operatives these days tend to use words like “indelible image” or “scar tissue” to describe how the memories still hit.

“We were all surprised,” acknowledged one senior Democrat involved with the reelection effort, asking not to be named to describe private strategy development.

“Anyone who is being honest was surprised Jan. 6 continues to be this resonant,” the person added. “But in hindsight, when you combine extreme rhetoric, extreme policy and lasting imagery, that ends up being a pretty powerful memory.”

The Trump campaign did not respond to questions sent by CNN about his embrace of January 6.

A running mate litmus test
Biden aides say January 6 and the footage from it will be a central feature of their advertising campaigns, the convention and beyond. They are counting on more attention from Trump’s trials, if those happen—and already, a Biden senior aide told CNN they have thought through how the president will keep talking about the topic while insisting he is sticking to not interfering in the legal process.

Trump, for his part, keeps talking about it and his aides aren’t really trying to stop him. The rally crowds keep cheering. And every ambitious Republican trying to get in Trump’s line of sight as he draws out the jockeying to be his running mate knows the bar for entry: Was Mike Pence in the wrong on January 6 — and if you were in a similar position in the future, would you be ready to toss out electoral votes in favor of a conspiracy to keep your losing boss in power?

New York. Rep. Elise Stefanik and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance have said that they would not have certified the election results in 2020 as constitutionally obligated. Stefanik would not commit to certifying the next election. South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott refused to say what he would have done if he was in Pence’s position at the time. Trump’s housing secretary Ben Carson and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum wouldn’t answer when asked if Pence did the right thing. As presidential candidates, Scott and Burgum had both indicated that Pence was in the right during a debate last August.

Pence has defended his actions many times. On Friday, he said he would not be endorsing Trump.

Faded hopes that January 6 would be ‘decisive moment’
Biden always says the reason he ran at all in 2020 was because he wouldn’t let America be a place where the 2017 neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville happened or was equivocated about from the White House. He started his presidency not wanting to believe that America would be a place where so many Republicans almost immediately absolved Trump, and where so many of those who didn’t quickly fell into line anyway.

Biden’s speech at the US Capitol on the one-year anniversary of January 6 at first seemed like a kind of capstone to the topic — and not as essentially a preview of the speech he would end up giving at Valley Forge on the third anniversary as a way to kick off his 2024 campaign year.

“There was a hope that January 6 would have been a decisive moment in terms of the threat to democracy. But it’s not. It’s an ongoing battle,” Donilon said.

Fewer Trump voters think the protesters who entered the Capitol were “mostly violent” than they did in the past, according to Washington Post-University of Maryland surveys from December of last year and in 2021. Among his supporters, there’s been a significant jump in the view that punishment is too harsh for those who broke into the Capitol from 45% to 57%, and nearly 9 in 10 of them now think that Trump bears little or no responsibility for the attack.

The same, though, cannot be said for most other Americans, including the kinds of voters who swung away from Trump in the last election. For example, 61% of college educated White voters still think the protesters who breached the Capitol walls were violent, up slightly from 2021. About 56 percent of independent voters continue to believe Trump was largely responsible for it, virtually unchanged during that stretch.

Congressional Republicans eager to give Trump more January 6 fodder
In one of his first moves after taking over the job, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced in November he would release all Capitol Hill security footage from January 6, 2021, that does not contain sensitive information.

GOP Rep. Barry Loudermilk of Georgia is spearheading the Republican-led investigation into the work of the former January 6 select committee, going after star witnesses of the probe and alleging the former select committee withheld witness transcripts from the public to undercut some of their most explosive claims.

That’s earned Loudermilk being called a “hero” by Trump at that rally in Georgia.

Meanwhile, leading Trump ally GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida introduced a largely symbolic resolution last month declaring Trump did not incite an insurrection or rebellion on January 6. More than one-third of the House Republican Conference have signed on.

Some are true believers. Some, said GOP Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, are attached because “I’m sure they are afraid not to.”

Some Republicans argue it’s the Democrats who are keeping the issue alive.

“It happened, not the very best day. But Democrats are focusing on it because they have nothing else to focus on,” GOP Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey said of January 6. “They have to make you look at the shiny object over here because otherwise you’re going to keep your eye on the game. And in the game, [Biden] is losing badly. He’s in trouble.”

Appeals to voters
Biden aides are confident that pardoning acts of political violence isn’t popular, but also isn’t anywhere near top of mind for people wondering what a president’s top three priorities are for Day One. But it’s more than that: While Trump is talking about what he will do for insurrectionists, Biden aides believe they’ll be able to make the case to voters that the president will make a difference in the lives of people who aren’t in jail for invading the Capitol.

Biden aides believe that argument draws in wavering swing voters, while seeing those images of January 6 will help keep anti-Trump Republicans repelled from the former president and lights up the Democratic base to boost turnout.

Aides know one of the issues they’re running up against is younger voters and voters of color who have been telling pollsters and focus groups that protecting “democracy” doesn’t mean as much to them because they start out skeptical that democracy was ever working that well. That’s why several top Democratic strategists working with the Biden campaign, as well as Harris herself, have been stressing “freedom” instead, believing that gets people more actively connected to abortion rights, LGBTQ rights and other fights.

But Biden aides say that’s a big part of why the images and memories of January 6 itself are so important.

Black voters have responded in focus groups by being offended to see the right to vote that they or their parents and grandparents fought for be abused like that. Those conversations can also quickly turn to dark speculation about how much rougher and bloody the response from law enforcement would have been if the rioters had been Black.

Latinos who either immigrated themselves or are children of immigrants have told focus groups that they are upset to see people disrespect the process that they worked so hard to take an oath of citizenship to be part of.

Matt Barreto – one of Biden’s pollsters in 2020 who then continued to conduct focus groups and polls for the Democratic National Committee and remains close to the reelection campaign – said that unlike abortion, Ukraine aid, Israel, or pretty much any other issue in a divided time, January 6 stands apart.

Barreto shared one response from a recent focus group of undecided Latino voters that he oversaw for a Latino advocacy group: “the way they’re going about it, and the time that is taking them to prosecute the criminal acts that he engaged in is just is very dangerous game they’re playing with—because a lot of his people are, for you know, a dictatorship. Apparently, they never had it, so they don’t know what it is, or if they do, they support it. And unfortunately, the U.S. is young, and we never had a dictatorship.”

“People are going to sit around and talk about the state of the economy, the cost of gas, and other things like that. Those frustrations are real. We know that, and we’re taking them very seriously,” Barreto said. “But when it gets to January 6, it still hits a nerve with people.”

Biden not only Democrat counting on January 6 revulsion
Biden isn’t the only Democrat counting on voters to be repelled by Trump’s approach to January 6. In Arizona, Democrats are hoping that the combination of Republican candidate Kari Lake’s 2020 election denialism and her refusal to accept the results of her own 2022 gubernatorial race will make her a more toxic candidate to voters who almost elected her last time.

Rep. Chris Deluzio, a Democrat running to hold onto his seat in a divided district in top presidential battleground Pennsylvania — where one of the local Republican leaders was a fake elector himself who has not been condemned by the congressman’s Republican challenger — said January 6 is “remarkably still out there for folks.”

“There are Republicans and independents who are just disgusted that their nominee is the guy who tried to rip up the Constitution,” Deluzio said. “Irrespective of politics, these aren’t our values.”

Will Rollins, a former federal prosecutor involved in several cases of Southern Californians who were at the Capitol that day and is running in a rematch as a Democrat against GOP Rep. Ken Calvert — who voted to overturn the results after the riot and said recently he hopes the people in jail get out — said that he hears constantly from independents and Republicans who say that Trump’s embrace of January 6 is continuing to drive them away.

“It’s become bigger than January 6. Those images of course are visceral for people, and we all remember seeing them on TV,” Rollins said. “It’s more of a forward-looking threat that people recognize. They’re thinking about not January 6 of 2021, but they’re thinking about the next certification in 2025.”",3/16/2024," Edward-Isaac Dovere, Steve Contorno and Annie Grayer",CNN,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Mike Donilon""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""CNN""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Kamala Harris""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020 election""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Capitol""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024 campaign""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Wilmington""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Election Day""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""January 6""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}]",0.47
Florida GOP Says State Is Solid Red: ‘Democrats Are Toast’,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/03/16/exclusive-florida-gop-says-state-is-solid-red-democrats-are-toast/,"Florida is a “solid red” state, the Republican Party of Florida (RPOF) says amid continued chatter of a Trump vs. Biden matchup in key swing states. But Florida, noticeably, has been absent from this conversation, and for good reason, according to the Florida GOP.

Following Nikki Haley’s departure from the Republican primary race after Super Tuesday, former President Donald Trump essentially became the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party. And while there has been a bit of speculation on President Joe Biden’s political future given mounting worries over his physical health and mental fitness, all signs point to a Trump vs. Biden rematch.

U.S. House of Representatives

With that, all eyes are looking to swing states. Poll after poll has analyzed these “battleground” states, which typically include Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan. Several of these polls as of late have shown Trump, not Biden, boasting the advantage — a great sign for Republicans moving into November. But absent from these articles analyzing “swing state” polls is Florida — once thought to be a solidly purple state, given its relatively back and forth history.

Florida has voted blue four times in presidential elections since 1976, going for Jimmy Carter in 1976, Bill Clinton in 1996, and Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. In recent history, all of these elections have been fairly tight. In 2012, for instance, Obama won the state by less than one percent. Trump defeated Clinton in Florida 2016 by 1.2 percent, and his victory in 2020 was even greater — a 3.3 percent margin.

But since then, Florida has experienced a boom in registered Republicans. In November 2021, for the first time in the state’s history, Florida Republicans outnumbered Democrats, and that lead has only continued to expand over the past four years.

As Breitbart News has documented:

From that moment on, Republicans have only continued to expand their lead, toppling Democrats by more than 100,000 mere months later, in March 2022. That figure doubled to 200,000 in July, and in December 2022, the figure stood around 350,000. In February 2023, Republicans outnumbered Democrats by 400,000 registered voters, and that figure swelled to 680,030 as of October 31, 2023, with Republicans having 5,153,695 voters to the Democrat party’s 4,473,665.

As of this year, Republicans now outnumber registered Democrats by over 850,000 voters — a massive advantage moving into the presidential election. Further, Republicans saw a taste of this in the midterm elections, as even Miami-Dade tipped to red — a phenomenon many attribute, partially at least, to how Gov. Ron DeSantis handled the coronavirus pandemic in the Sunshine State.

So while Florida has been historically considered a purple state, the RPOF believes that it is now a “solid red state,” following what it described as the “Republican red wave in 2022,” concluding that “Floridians reject the progressive policies Biden Democrats advocate.”

Florida Republican Chairman Evan Power detailed this phenomenon further in a statement exclusively to Breitbart News.

“In 2020, Trump won Florida by 3.3 percent when Democrats led by over 100,000 registered voters. In 2024, Republicans lead Dems by over 854,318 votes. Imagine what that will deliver in November!” he previewed, making it clear that the GOP will not slow down, either.

“Florida Democrats are toast, but we won’t let our confidence keep us from working hard to deliver Florida’s electoral votes to President Trump,” he said.

“Americans cannot afford another four years of Biden Democrats who have crippled the economy and endangered our national security. That’s why Republican voter registration numbers are growing,” Power continued, harkening back to the years of the Trump administration.

“Everyone remembers the great years under the Trump administration that gave us lower taxes, the return of American manufacturing, energy independence, a bustling economic environment, and a secure border,” Power said. “We are ready to make history – again!”",3/16/2024,HANNAH BLEAU KNUDSEN,BREITBART,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""North Carolina""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Barack Obama""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Florida""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Wisconsin""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Super Tuesday""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Georgia""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican Party""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""swing states""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""RPOF""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Bill Clinton""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Nevada""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""U.S. House of Representatives""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Jimmy Carter""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Arizona""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""presidential elections""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Pennsylvania""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Nikki Haley""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""State of the Union""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Michigan""}]",0.42
"‘A campaign for vengeance’: critics warn of a radical second Trump term
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/17/critics-warn-radical-second-trump-term,"The US election primary season is in effect over. Conventional wisdom holds that the two major candidates will now pivot towards the centre ground in search of moderate voters. But Donald Trump has never been one for conventional wisdom.
Detention camps, mass deportations, capital punishment for drug smugglers, tariffs on imported goods, a purge of the justice department and potential withdrawal from Nato – the Trump policy agenda is radical by any standard including his own, pushing the boundaries set during his first presidential run eight years ago.

“In 2016 he was still, in his own mind at least, positioning himself to be beloved by everybody,” said Kurt Bardella, a Democratic strategist. “That’s why ‘Drain the swamp’ was a more populist, appealing message to all sides of the aisle because everyone on some level felt like Washington’s broken, Washington’s left us behind.

In a lot of ways Trump is Ahab and Moby Dick is the United States of America
Democratic strategist Kurt Bardella
“Now you flash-forward to 2024 and we’re getting a much darker version of Donald Trump, one who seems to be driven by imaginary grievances from the 2020 election. There’s nothing unifying about that message in any way; it’s incredibly self-centred. This is a campaign for vengeance. In a lot of ways he is Ahab and Moby Dick is the United States of America.”

Eight years ago Trump, seeking to become the first US president with no prior political or military experience, was running with a clean slate. If anything, there was a suspicion that his background as a thrice-married New York celebrity implied some ideological fluidity and latent liberal instincts.

But he announced his candidacy in June 2015 by promising to build a wall on the southern border, using xenophobic language to portray Mexicans as “criminals” and “rapists” and promising to “make America great again”.

During the campaign he described international trade deals as “a disaster” and called for increased tariffs on imports. He promised sweeping tax cuts and vowed to repeal Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act and environmental regulations, describing the climate crisis as “a total hoax”.

Trump pledged to nominate supreme court justices opposed to abortion and, in one TV interview, suggested that women who have abortions should be punished. With backing from the National Rifle Association, he opposed gun safety reforms.

Overseas, the Republican candidate deployed the slogan “America first”, questioning the Nato alliance while calling for improved relations with Russia. He vowed to destroy the Islamic State and called for “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on”.

Trump did implement his first attempt at a Muslim ban almost immediately after taking the Oval Office in January 2017, prompting protests, airport chaos and a long legal battle in the courts. The supreme court ruled in June 2018 that the third iteration of the law could go into full effect, meaning considerable restrictions on Muslim travellers entering the country.

Trump failed to overturn the Affordable Care Act, but his presidency was hugely consequential in other ways. His $1.5tn tax cut added to the national debt and, research has shown, helped billionaires more than the working class. The US pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. Trump reshaped the federal judiciary and appointed three supreme court justices who would be instrumental in ending the constitutional right to abortion.

He botched the response to a coronavirus pandemic that has now left more than a million Americans dead, initially underplaying the threat and later suggesting that patients might inject bleach as a cure. In the summer of 2020, Trump is said to have wanted the US military to shoot peaceful protesters in Washington during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations.

In the aftermath of his 2020 election defeat, and dozens of criminal charges against him, Trump’s extremism has broadened and deepened as he heads into an electoral rematch with Joe Biden. He won the Republican primaries with ease, prompting commentators to warn of “collective amnesia” and “the banality of chaos” as many voters seemingly become numb to his demagoguery.

However, an AP VoteCast poll found six in 10 moderate Republicans in New Hampshire and South Carolina were concerned that Trump was too extreme to win a general election.

For example, he now argues that presidents should have total immunity and openly threatens the guardrails of American democracy. “I only want to be a dictator for one day,” he told supporters in Manchester, New Hampshire, earlier this year.

He has said he would try to strip tens of thousands of career employees of their civil service protections as he seeks to “totally obliterate the deep state”. Given his rage at the FBI and federal prosecutors pursuing criminal cases against him, Trump may target people linked to those prosecutions for retribution.

He’s even uglier in his language now. He’s even more cruel in his approach. He’s gotten much more extreme
Former Republican congressman Joe Walsh
His signature issue, border security, is once again taking centre stage with record levels of migrants caught crossing into the US. In response, he has pledged to launch the biggest deportation effort in American history. This would involve far-reaching roundups and detention camps to hold people while they await removal, the New York Times reported. He has also refused to rule out reinstating a Muslim travel ban and a hugely controversial family separation policy.

Trump further wants to build more of the border wall – his first administration built 450 miles (724km) of barriers across the 1,954-mile (3,144km) border, but much of that replaced existing structures. He also wants to end automatic citizenship for children born in the US to immigrants living in the country illegally, an idea he flirted with as president.
The former Republican congressman Joe Walsh said: “He’s even uglier in his language now. He’s even more cruel in his approach. He’s gotten much more extreme, which you would think means, oh my God, how stupid politically, because he needs people in the middle. But it is big issue and Democrats have never understood how important immigration and the border are and so Trump feels as if he can demagogue it in even more of an extreme fashion.”

Trump has called for the death penalty for drug smugglers and those who traffic women and children. In a broader anti-crime push, he says he will require local law enforcement agencies to use divisive policing measures including stop-and-frisk. Last year, he told a rally in Anaheim, California: “Very simply, if you rob a store, you can fully expect to be shot as you are leaving that store.”

Under the mantra “Drill, baby, drill”, Trump says that he would increase oil drilling on public lands and offer tax breaks to oil, gas and coal producers. He would again exit the Paris climate accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate environmental regulations.

Trump has suggested that he is open to making cuts to the social security and Medicare welfare programmes. But one area in which he has hinted at moderation is abortion, publicly acknowledging that the national ban favoured by some Republicans would be electoral kryptonite, although it was reported last month that he privately expressed support for a 16-week limit with exceptions.

Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: “His campaign has been smart to float the 16-week ban because I think most Americans fall somewhere between 16 and 20 weeks as something they can live with. If he basically says the federal government will not try to do a six-week ban, we’re not going to come after a foetal heartbeat bill – so if you live in a swing state like Michigan that has codified abortion, I’m not coming after you – that is strategically a smart position. But it would be considered a modification to the centre on abortion by Trump.”

He is an empty vessel for these other people around him who do have very specific policy ideas, most of them rooted in straight authoritarianism
Reed Galen of the Lincoln Project
On foreign policy, Trump claims that even before he is inaugurated, he will have settled the war between Russia and Ukraine. Last week, after visiting the former president at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Hungary’s autocratic prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said Trump promised him that he would end Russia’s war with Ukraine by not giving “a single penny” in aid.

The Republican nominee also says he will continue to “fundamentally re-evaluate” Nato’s purpose and mission. At one recent rally, he said he would “encourage” Vladimir Putin’s Russia to attack Nato allies who do not pay their bills. And he says he will institute a system of tariffs of perhaps 10% on most foreign goods.

Sometimes it can all seem like campaign bluster unlikely to survive the scrutiny of advisers, Congress or the courts. But whereas Trump’s 2016 win took everyone by surprise, perhaps including him, resulting in a first term marred by infighting and hastily written executive orders, this time there are allies who consider a second term is possible, or even probable, and are ready to hit the ground running.

Trump’s campaign and groups such as the Heritage Foundation and America First Policy Institute thinktanks are assembling Project 2025 policy books with detailed plans. Groups of conservative lawyers are sizing up what orders Trump might issue on a second presidency’s first day. With lessons learned, his administration could be even more ruthless and efficient.

Lanhee Chen, a fellow in American public policy studies at the Hoover Institution thinktank in Stanford, California, said: “Some of the general framing and themes around what it is he wants to do are relatively consistent. What is different this time around is that there’s more of an architecture and infrastructure supporting a lot of these policy proposals.

“If you look at the ecosystem of organisations that’s involved in helping him think through what a second term agenda would look like, it’s much more robust in 2024 than it was in 2016. So I don’t necessarily subscribe to the view that the substance is all that different or somehow more extreme. It’s just there’s a lot more people who are thinking about it. Some of them are authorised; some of them are probably not authorised.”

Critics of Trump warn that, while Trump himself has few core beliefs, he would effectively become a vehicle for extremists to push a far-right agenda wildly out of step with the majority of Americans. Reed Galen, a co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, said: “He is an empty vessel for these other people around him who do have very specific policy ideas, most of them rooted in straight authoritarianism or some noxious mix of authoritarianism and Christian dominionism.

“He doesn’t care. For all of it, it’s a means to an end. If I win do these people help me or do they hurt me? Do they give me more control? Do they give me less control? Do they give me more access to making sure I’m never going to go to jail, that I can persecute and prosecute my political enemies, that I can make life harder for the media?”

Galen added: “In many ways, he is the leader of the torchlight parade but he’s being taken arm in arm and pushed from behind by a bunch of very noxious individuals with what I would call fundamentally anti-democratic and un-American ideology.”",3/17/2024,David Smith ,The Guardian,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Nato""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""New York""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""America""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Moby Dick""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020 election""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""justice department""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Drain the swamp""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""US""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Washington""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""United States of America""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Kurt Bardella""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Ahab""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democratic""}]",0.41
"Biden campaign readies health care fight in latest attack on Trump
",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/28/politics/biden-campaign-health-care-trump/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc,"The Biden campaign is seizing on former President Donald Trump’s recent threat to repeal Obamacare, marking their latest effort to sound the alarm on the GOP frontrunner’s policy vision.

The campaign is readying surrogates, messaging pushes and a TV ad aimed at drawing a stark contrast between President Joe Biden’s work to improve health care and costs related to it, and Trump’s approach. And it comes at a time when the Affordable Care Act is seeing a spike in sign ups for 2024 coverage in the initial weeks of open enrollment.

The Biden campaign’s push is the latest step in a strategy to put Trump’s policy proposals front and center as they seek to draw a starker contrast with the GOP frontrunner heading into 2024. Recent polling has shown the former president leading Biden in key battleground states and on the national level. The Biden campaign views the health care fight as fruitful ground as Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare have repeatedly failed, prompting some in the GOP to refrain from campaigning to push for its end.

The effort comes in the days after Trump said Republicans should “never give up” on trying to repeal the landmark Obama-era health reform law, adding that he was “seriously looking at alternatives.” Trump said Obamacare’s cost is “out of control, plus, it’s not good Healthcare,” adding the failure to repeal it was “a low point for the Republican Party.”  The former president’s comments on Truth Social came in response to a Wall Street Journal op-ed on the issue.

The Biden campaign has looked to boost Trump’s comments on social media, and Biden himself weighed in on the health care divide on Monday.

“My predecessor’s – once again, God love him – call for cuts that could rip away health insurance for tens of millions of Americans,” Biden said at a White House event on supply chains. “They just don’t give up. But guess what? We won’t let these things happen.”

For Democrats, being able to run in defense of the Affordable Care Act is a dramatic reversal of fortune from a decade ago. GOP presidential and congressional candidates successfully ran against the legislation for years after its passage. When Republicans regained control of the House in 2010, they called their landslide victory a mandate to dismantle the health care law. By March 2014, Obamacare’s four year anniversary, Republicans had attempted to repeal all or part of the law more than 50 times, according to an analysis by the Washington Post. Those efforts were blocked by Democrats.

When Republicans finally had the ability to repeal Obamacare in 2017 under Trump and a GOP Congress, however, they couldn’t produce a plan with enough support to pass. Former Sen. John McCain of Arizona famously doomed his party’s effort to repeal key parts of the health care law with a dramatic thumbs-down vote.

The Trump-era repeal attempt ultimately helped boost the law’s popularity. The number of Americans who said they had a favorable opinion of the law rose above 50% for the first time in mid-2017, according to polling by the Kaiser Family Foundation. A year later, Democrats won back control of the House in 2018 after campaigning in part on their opponents’ efforts to repeal the law.

Fifty-nine percent of Americans said they had a favorable view of the law as of May 2023, according to the most recent polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Most Republicans are trying to move on.

“I don’t think it is a winner of an issue, and so I don’t understand why [Trump] would have brought it up,” said Barrett Marson, an Arizona-based Republican strategist.

Obamacare is “ingrained in American society,” he said, adding that he doesn’t hear politicians discussing repealing it anymore.

“There are so many other issues to focus on that will motivate Republicans and right leaning independents to the polls,” Marson said. “Obamacare just isn’t one of them.”

Biden’s team seizes on Trump’s comments
On Tuesday, the Biden campaign held a call featuring former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, whose state will start its Medicaid expansion on Friday, to respond to Trump’s threats. North Carolina will be the 40th state to take advantage of an Obamacare provision to broaden Medicaid to more low-income adults after years of resistance by Republican state legislators.

“In 2024, the Affordable Care Act and all of its transformational benefits will be on the ballot,” Pelosi said. “The American people will need to know that if Donald Trump wins next year, he’s coming for your health care. But if Joe Biden wins, your health care will be safe and sound.”

“It was hard for me to believe that Donald Trump is actually bringing up this ACA threat once again, but as Speaker Pelosi says we’ve got to believe him because he tried it before, and almost succeeded,” Cooper added.

Biden’s team plans on running a new health care focused TV ad in Las Vegas – in the key battleground state of Nevada – and national cable later in the week, a campaign official said. The campaign also is seeking to call attention to various health care provisions Biden has worked to improve and protect, including coverage for pre-existing conditions.

The campaign also will lean on state Democratic parties in swing states to host events this week to talk about the effects of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the official said.

Trump “was one vote away from getting it done when he was president – and we should take him at his word that he’ll try to do it again,” said Biden campaign spokesperson Ammar Moussa. “Donald Trump’s America is one where millions of people lose their health insurance and seniors and families across the country face exorbitant costs just to stay healthy. Those are the stakes next November.”

It’s not just the campaign looking to build off Trump’s comments. The White House used the moment to slam congressional Republicans over health care, arguing in a memo that they “keep proving that the top objective of MAGAnomics is tax giveaways for rich special interests, even if it means major price hikes on families.”

“Nowhere is the MAGAnomics threat to middle class families’ bottom lines more severe than when it comes to health care,” wrote White House spokesperson Andrew Bates.

Bates also highlighted several of Obamacare’s most popular provisions, including barring insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on people’s pre-existing conditions, allowing children to stay on their parents’ plans up to age 26, banning insurers from levying higher premiums on women compared to men, providing free mammograms, colon cancer screenings and other preventive care and expanding Medicaid to more lower-income Americans.

Biden’s efforts to strengthen the Affordable Care Act
Obamacare is enjoying increased popularity under the Biden administration. Nearly 4.6 million people have signed up for 2024 coverage in the first three weeks of this year’s open enrollment period, which began November 1. That’s an increase of 36% from the same period a year earlier. Plan selections have increased heftily in many red states, including Mississippi, Tennessee, Ohio and South Carolina.

Soon after taking office in 2021, Biden moved to bolster Obamacare after years of the Trump administration’s efforts to chip away at the program. In one the most significant moves, the president and congressional Democrats beefed up federal subsidies for Obamacare policies as part of the 2021 American Rescue Plan Act and renewed the more generous assistance as part of last year’s Inflation Reduction Act. The enhanced subsidies – which enable four out of five people to find a plan for less than $10 a month – continue through 2025.

Plus, Biden reopened enrollment to allow the uninsured to gain coverage during the Covid-19 pandemic. His administration also lengthened the annual open enrollment period and poured money into programs to help people sign up for coverage, as well as opened up federal subsidies to more families.

These efforts, along with a congressional Covid-19 pandemic relief provision that barred states from unenrolling residents from Medicaid, has led the nation’s uninsured rate to drop to a record low 7.2% in the second quarter of this year. However, that rate is expected to rise now that the relief measure has expired, and more than 11 million people have lost their Medicaid coverage since the beginning of April, according to a KFF tracker.",3/17/2024,"Arlette Saenz, Tami Luhby and Arit John",CNN,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""supply chains""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Biden campaign""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""battleground states""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""open enrollment""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""national level""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""White House""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican Party""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Wall Street Journal""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Truth Social""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""GOP""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Obamacare""}]",0.4
"Behind the scenes, Biden has grown angry and anxious about re-election effort
",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-anger-rcna143729,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden was seething.

In a private meeting at the White House in January, allies of the president had just told him that his poll numbers in Michigan and Georgia had dropped over his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. 

Both are battleground states he narrowly won four years ago, and he can’t afford any backsliding if he is to once again defeat Donald Trump. He began to shout and swear, a lawmaker familiar with the meeting said. 

He believed he had been doing what was right, despite the political fallout, he told the group, according to the lawmaker.

Asked about the episode, Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said: “President Biden makes national security decisions based on the country’s national security needs alone — no other factor.”

For months, Democrats have watched the 2024 campaign unfold with rising alarm as the sitting president struggles to gain ground against his defeated predecessor. Frustrations rippling through the party have reached the top, with Biden at times second-guessing travel decisions and communications strategies that have left much of the electorate clueless about his record, interviews with nearly 20 lawmakers, present and past administration officials and Biden allies show.

The starting gun for the general election campaign fired last week as Biden wrapped up the Democratic nomination. Yet he is still searching for ways to impress upon voters that he deserves a second term by dint of policy achievements that eluded past presidents.

History suggests it will be tough for him to recover. Biden’s 38% approval rating at this stage in the calendar is lower than that of the last three presidents who went on to lose re-election: Trump (48%), George H.W. Bush (39%) and Jimmy Carter (43%), according to Gallup survey data.

Biden has long believed that he isn’t getting sufficient credit for an economy that has created 15 million new jobs. Looking to reach distracted voters who may be tuning in, he told his speechwriters before the State of the Union address to tone down some of the lofty rhetoric and plainly lay out what he’s done, a person familiar with speech preparations said.

During internal discussions, he’ll press aides about which parts of his record to highlight in different states, said a second person who is familiar with the matter.

Surrounded by protective aides who want to minimize the chances of a flub, the 81-year-old president has chafed at restraints that he sees as counter to his natural instincts as a retail politician, a third person familiar with internal discussions said.

He has felt cocooned at times and has been eager to get out more, meet voters face-to-face and take the fight directly to Trump, said the third person and a fourth also familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss campaign strategy and the president’s private views.

There are signs that some within his party are also losing patience with him.

“Biden stood up in front of the whole world and said, ‘I’m ready. I’m the guy who can take down Donald Trump,’” said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash. “So, he goddamn well better do it. We don’t have time for him to be worried about whether or not people are saying things right or the poll numbers are where they should be. I want focused energy and not defensive anger.”

Eminently beatable 
Biden has on occasion directed his ire at his tightknit senior staff. Given the successes he has had in passing consequential bills and improving the economy, Biden was irritated that his message wasn’t sinking in with the broader electorate, the sources said.

Eight months before the election, Biden’s campaign team remains confident about his chances.

A memo that campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez sent out in December suggests that it was always the plan for Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to start “ramping up” campaign travel early this year — something that is now happening.

Since the State of the Union speech, Biden has traveled to Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania. He’ll be heading to Nevada and Arizona early this week.

“The president and his advisers have all been eager for him to be out there more and planned for that to take place at the start of the election year, as has been the norm for past incumbents seeking re-election,” the second person familiar with the matter said.

Biden aides see Trump as an eminently beatable and deeply flawed opponent. In a recent campaign call with reporters, Jen O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chairwoman, said Trump appears to have little interest in attracting voters beyond his most faithful base.

“We know that he lost in 2020,” she said. “In order to win, he’s got to expand his base of voters to find new people to be with him. And that is not something he’s shown that he’s really focused on.”

‘A little mad at himself’
At times, Biden gets suggestions that conflict with one another. Some advisers have told him he should walk faster out of concern that his gait feeds impressions that he’s too old. And yet the White House is sufficiently worried about him tripping that he has taken to boarding Air Force One via a shorter staircase through the belly of the plane, forgoing the iconic image of the president waving from the main doorway high above the tarmac.

“He’s probably a little mad at himself for not being more forceful with the staff,” a person familiar with internal discussions said.

Privately, Biden questions whether he should trust his gut instincts over the guidance coming from the array of advisers tending to his political interests, this person added.

“The man’s been successful for decades in Congress and became vice president and president,” said a fifth person, who formerly served in the Biden administration. “If you try to change the person, you’re making a mistake. Let the president go out there and do his thing.”

‘A failure of communication’
A consensus of Democratic officials is that Biden needs an army of surrogates to spread the word that his record has improved American lives in concrete ways. He can’t carry the message alone. 

Andre Dickens, the Democratic mayor of Atlanta, said that Trump’s bluster tends to soak up the attention, but Biden’s record is actually making city streets safer. He cited spending bills that enabled his city to pay retention bonuses to police officers and underwrite youth programs that help to curb crime.

“Coming after a blowhard like Trump who tells you every day what he hates and what he likes, Biden is … soft and calm and getting the work done,” Dickens said.

Letting voters know is “the job of the mayor and county leaders who have benefited from the Biden administration’s policies,” he added.

Simplicity might be Biden’s most promising approach, some of his allies said. Package his record as part of an American renaissance — a success story that is putting money into peoples’ pockets, they suggested.

Mary Landrieu is a former Democratic senator from Louisiana and a Biden supporter. Asked about Biden’s inability to get credit for legislation meant to revive American high-tech manufacturing and upgrade the country’s roads and bridges, she said: “I think it’s actually a bit of a failure of communication on the part of the White House.”

Nearly $4 billion in clean energy projects are underway in Louisiana under a bill that Biden ushered into law called the Inflation Reduction Act, a title that doesn’t capture the measure’s real purpose.

“There’s a real story to tell,” Landrieu said. “It’s a winning message and it’s about jobs, prosperity and evolution. If that message can be communicated, I think the American people will respond.”",3/17/2024,"Peter Nicholas, Courtney Kube and Carol E.

"Biden and Democratic Party organizations raised $53 million in February
",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-democratic-party-organizations-raised-53-million-february-rcna143739,"President Joe Biden’s campaign and its connected fundraising organizations raised $53 million in February, the campaign announced on Sunday, giving them a collective $155 million in the bank at the end of last month.

That’s a $25 million increase over the combined cash on hand for the Biden campaign, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic state parties at the end of January. And it came as Biden and former President Donald Trump clinched their party nominations and kicked off the general election.

In statement, the campaign said February was its strongest grassroots fundraising month since its launch in April of last year. The joint campaign effort pointed to big moments in the month as drivers for large cash hauls, including an email to donors from first lady Jill Biden.

Jill Biden was closely involved in crafting an email that went out after the release of special counsel Robert Hur’s report on Biden’s handling of classified documents after his vice presidency. Hur concluded that no charges should be filed against the president. But the White House went after Hur, accusing him of making unnecessary comments about Biden’s age and memory.

Jill Biden’s campaign message in defense of her husband generated $853,000 in February, the campaign said.

“We’re proud of the record-breaking fundraising machine we’ve built that is going toward reaching the voters about the stakes of this election,” campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said in a statement. She added that the money would help expand the campaign’s state-level operations, invest in paid media and pay for Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and their spouses to campaign across the country.

The campaign also touted $2 million from small-dollar contributors donated just on Feb. 29.

"Trump plays attack dog for Bernie Moreno as Ohio's GOP Senate primary ends on a vicious note
",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-bernie-moreno-ohio-gop-senate-primary-rcna142861,"VANDALIA, Ohio — Ohio’s Republican Senate primary was already a mean-spirited and mudslinging affair, careening viciously toward a tight and bitter finish.

And then Donald Trump came to town.

The former president touched down for a Saturday-afternoon rally to boost Bernie Moreno, who despite snagging his endorsement three months ago has failed to distance himself decisively from his GOP rivals.

Trump was on the attack, whipping the crowd into a frenzy against state Sen. Matt Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians. Dolan’s emergence as Moreno’s strongest opponent, accentuated in the last week with endorsements from Gov. Mike DeWine and former Sen. Rob Portman, has reinforced distinct battle lines: MAGA vs. Ohio’s old-guard conservative establishment, which pales as moderate in comparison to Trump’s politics.

In his 90-minute speech at Dayton International Airport, Trump called Moreno a “fantastic guy” and hammered Dolan as a “RINO” — or Republican in name only.

“Bernie is running against a weak RINO named Matt Dolan. He is trying to become the next Mitt Romney,” Trump said, referring to the Utah senator who was the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and is now a prominent Trump critic. “I think Mitt Romney is his hero.”

Trump reminded the crowd that Dolan ran, unsuccessfully, as a Democrat for a state legislative seat more than 30 years ago. Trump also complained about how the Dolan family’s Major League Baseball franchise changed its name from the Indians to the Guardians in 2021, amid concerns that the old name was offensive to Native Americans.

“He’s easily pushed around by woke left-wing lunatics who renamed his family’s baseball team,” said Trump, who surveyed the audience for its opinions on the rebranding and elicited a strong response in favor of the old name. “My attitude is anybody who changes the name from the Cleveland Indians to the Cleveland Guardians should not be a senator.”

Dolan’s father, Larry, is the principal owner of the team, and his brother, Paul, serves as CEO. Though he has worked closely with the team, Dolan has said he had no involvement with the name change.

Trump did not refer to the third candidate in the GOP primary, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose.

Moreno, a political novice and former car dealer, is hoping to ride Trump’s support into a general election matchup against Sen. Sherrod Brown, one of the most vulnerable Democrats on the ballot this fall. Trump’s appearance — three days before the primary and less than two weeks after a source close to the former president said that an Ohio rally for Moreno was “highly unlikely” — created the feel of another salesman being called in to close the deal.

The results of Tuesday’s primary could have profound ramifications for Trump in a state he won twice by 8-point margins. If Moreno wins, Trump can take credit for carrying an inexperienced candidate to victory. If Moreno loses, Trump will face questions about the value of his endorsement in tough races, in this case the first competitive 2024 Senate primary in which he picked a favorite. 

There have been few independent polls in the race, but two surveys over the last week showed a tight race between Moreno and Dolan. The hostile nature of the race escalated Friday, after The Associated Press reported on a potential link between a Moreno email address and an account with Adult Friend Finder, a website known for arranging sexual encounters.

The AP did not verify that Moreno himself had set up the account and quoted a letter provided by Moreno’s attorney, which the campaign also provided to NBC News, in which former intern Dan Ricci wrote that he “created the … account in question” as a “prank” and apologized “to him and his family for any harm this foolishness has caused them.”

NBC News has not independently corroborated the report. Ricci did not respond to a request for comment.

“The email address in question was not Bernie’s personal email address, but rather an email address that appeared on company websites and literature and was managed by staff,” Moreno attorney Charles Harder said in a statement the campaign provided to NBC News. “Multiple people had access to it, including this intern. Bernie Moreno had nothing to do with the AFF account. According to metadata, the AFF account was never even used — there were no communications or contacts sent to or from any other AFF accounts, and no photos or content were uploaded to it. The AFF account existed for less than a half-day, 16 years ago.”

Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung issued a statement defending Moreno and calling the AP report “shameful.” And Andrew Cornu, the founder of Adult Friend Finder, posted Saturday on X that after his own review, he found the situation “consistent with a prank or someone just checking out the site.”

But the surfacing of the account, which according to the AP was set up to attract “young guys” and had been the subject of rumors for weeks among GOP operatives, gave rivals a late opening to argue that a Moreno nomination would ensure Brown’s re-election.

A new ad released Friday by the Dolan-aligned Buckeye Leadership Fund emphasizes some of the most salacious aspects of the AP report. The 30-second spot was supposed to run statewide on TV and radio as part of the PAC’s existing advertising plan, spokesperson Chris Pack said.

“Creepy, huh? Moreno is damaged goods,” the narrator in the ad says before referring to a Democratic strategy to meddle in the primary with an ad promoting Moreno’s conservative positions. “That’s why Democrats are spending millions to prop up Moreno in the Republican primary, so Sherrod Brown can beat him in November.”

Dolan sidestepped questions about the AP report Friday before a GOP dinner in Salem, south of Youngstown, and said he was not aware of the super PAC’s ad. LaRose, speaking with reporters after the dinner, was more eager to address the issue.

“I’ve been saying from the beginning that I don’t think Mr. Moreno is trustworthy,” he said. “And I’m not going to say much more about it other than, you know, obviously, if that’s true, it’s a horrible thing for his family, and I keep them in our prayers.”

A source close to Moreno’s campaign said at least 10 TV stations have refused to run the Buckeye Leadership Fund ad following cease-and-desist notices from Moreno’s legal counsel. Bridget Moreno, the candidate’s wife, issued a statement Saturday calling on Dolan to denounce the ad. A Dolan spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.

Trump briefly alluded to the matter Saturday.

“They’re doing a number on him,” Trump said, dismissing the article as “disinformation and misinformation.”

Backed by $10 million in personal loans and millions more from friendly super PACs, Dolan has run an aggressive ad campaign to promote his policy positions and attack his rivals. A lawyer whose family struck it rich in cable television before buying Cleveland’s Major League Baseball franchise, Dolan hasn’t run away from Trump. But he hasn’t run close to him, either, acknowledging that he has a much different personality. That has opened him up to the “RINO” attacks.

Though he didn’t mention Dolan by name at Saturday’s rally, Moreno noted in his remarks how his rival did not think the debate over U.S. border security should distract from support for Ukraine and mocked him for an endorsement from The Plain Dealer, a Cleveland newspaper.

“You’re going to go vote on Tuesday and send a clear message to the swamp RINOs that they’re done,” Moreno told the audience.

LaRose, who entered the race with high name recognition thanks to two statewide election wins, has struggled to compete with the independently wealthy Dolan and Moreno on the money front. The secretary of state has relied heavily on an allied super PAC to promote him, but that group, Leadership for Ohio, has recently spent its money to attack the other candidates. Moreno and Dolan have trained their fire on each other in the final days, largely ignoring LaRose.

“I mean, you always want to have more resources to get your message out there,” LaRose said Friday after the dinner in Salem. “But Ohioans know BS when they hear it.”

Throughout the week, voters and activists at GOP events across Ohio described a two-person race between Moreno and Dolan.

“I would say that this is a crucial time for the state of Ohio,” Sherri Garner Brumbaugh, a Moreno supporter, said at this week’s Lake County Republican Party dinner in Eastlake, near Cleveland. “So we are going to be traditional, old-school Republicans, or we’re going to change ourselves as Republicans. I’m looking for that change in Washington, and Bernie Moreno is going to bring it.”

Amy Sabath, a GOP operative who has consulted for DeWine and Dolan and attended the same dinner, explained why she was partial to Dolan.

“The ultraconservative vote is probably going to split between Moreno and LaRose,” Sabath said. “But I’m hoping there’s a nice path for Dolan to come up through the middle with the more, I don’t want to say ‘moderate Republicans,’ but maybe that is the better word. I’ve always considered myself an ultraconservative Republican, but I just believe in the right candidate, and the right candidate is Dolan.”

The challenge for Dolan — knitting together a winning coalition of GOP voters that includes those who are ready to move on from Trump — was on display this week as he attempted to win over voters in Aurora, a suburb near Cleveland.

“My heart says until Trump is gone I will never vote Republican again,” Reed Fuller told Dolan after the candidate knocked on his door Tuesday. “Sorry.”

Aurora Mayor Ann Womer Benjamin, who accompanied Dolan, tried to vouch for him.

“Well, he’s not a Trump person,” she interjected.

“I know, I realize that,” Fuller said. “I’m sorry. If I had to choose between the three, I’d be with you.”",3/17/2024,Henry J.

"Biden Campaign Raises Over $53 Million In February
",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-53-million-february-fundraising_n_65f6283ae4b08b384f1b726d,"Even as President Joe Biden has tried to fend off growing questions about his age and electability, he continued to inspire donations from supporters last month, bringing in $53 million, according to his reelection campaign.

The February haul — the combined total raised by Biden’s campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and authorized joint fundraising committees — is an increase from the $42 million that Biden raised in January. The campaign’s consistently strong fundraising has enabled Biden to amass $155 million in cash on hand, the largest amount any Democratic presidential candidate has ever raised at this point in the election cycle, his campaign said Sunday.

“President Biden continues to see record-breaking grassroots enthusiasm around a historic and winning agenda, while Donald Trump is poised to enter the general election broke, saddled by his unwavering support for the extremism Americans repeatedly reject at the ballot box,” Biden deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty said in a statement.

The campaign is not relying on big checks alone, suggesting that grassroots enthusiasm for the president still runs deep. In February, Biden received 562,000 contributions from 469,000 unique donors, according to the campaign. And since he began running for reelection, 97% of all individual donations were under $200.

Biden and Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, both clinched their respective party nominations on Tuesday, after primary wins enabled them to lock up a majority of convention delegates.

Neither candidate’s hold on the nomination was ever seriously in doubt, but Trump’s nearest rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, gave him a run for his money in some key states, and won Vermont and the District of Columbia. And unlike Biden, Trump has only just begun fully coordinating with the Republican National Committee.

As a result of his preoccupation with the primary, mounting legal costs and overall management failures, Trump is seriously behind Biden in fundraising. In January, he raised $8.9 million and spent more than $11 million, ending the month with just over $30 million in cash on hand.

The RNC has also struggled to raise money, bringing in less in 2023 than in any year since 2015. Trump retook control of the RNC earlier this month, appointing ally Michael Whatley as chair and daughter-in-law Lara Trump as co-chair.

Trump’s campaign has insisted that he will not use the money from coordinated fundraising with the RNC to cover legal bills. But through the authorized Save America PAC and the Make America Great Again PAC — a super PAC that is technically barred from coordinating with Trump — Trump spent more than $54 million of donors’ money on legal bills in 2023.

For his part, Biden has been trying to capitalize on momentum generated by his aggressive State of the Union speech earlier this month.

"Biden Takes Down Trump With 3-Word Punchline At DC Roast
",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-roast-donald-trump-gridiron-club_n_65f67885e4b0b4d0b8999ea3,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The big news this week, President Joe Biden said at a weekend Washington roast, was that two candidates had clinched their party’s nomination for president. But one was too old, too mentally unfit for the job, he said.

“The other’s me,” Biden quipped.

The digs against Republican Donald Trump kept coming from the president at the annual Gridiron Club and Foundation Dinner, as Biden deflected ongoing criticism that his memory is hazy and he appears confused, instead highlighting moments when the 77-year-old Trump has slipped up, too.

“Don’t tell him, he thinks he’s running against Barack Obama, that’s what he said,” said Biden, 81, who also quipped that he was staying up way past his bedtime.

It was the first time Biden has attended the dinner during his presidency, and comes as the 2024 election looms and the rematch between Biden and Trump heats up. The annual bacchanalia, now in its 139th year, traces its history to 1885 — that was the year President Grover Cleveland refused to attend. Every president since has come to at least one Gridiron.

Biden veered quickly into the somber, though, highlighting what he sees as a real threat to democracy should Trump — who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen — return to the White House. The speech had echoes of Biden’s campaign remarks, criticizing Trump as well as too soft on Russian President Vladimir Putin.

“We live in an unprecedented moment in democracy,” he said. “An unprecedented moment for history. Democracy and freedom are literally under attack. Putin’s on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down to him and says to him, ‘do whatever the hell you want.’”

Biden then introduced the Ukrainian ambassador, Oksana Markarova, and Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas.

“We will not bow down. They will not bow down, and I will not bow down,” he said.

Biden, dressed in white-tie attire as is the custom, brought his daughter Ashley.

The dinner has a reputation as a night of bipartisan mirth, and was jam-packed with politicians and who’s-who of Washington, including Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff, at least eight other Cabinet members, at least five members of Congress, five governors and at least five ambassadors. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who’s in town for St. Patrick’s Day, also attended.

Also speaking at the dinner were Harris, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox, a Republican.

Biden closed out the dinner, speaking also about the importance of a free press. Although he may not agree with everything the news media prints, he said, he understands the necessity of journalism and said he was still working to bring home journalists Evan Gershovich and Austin Tice, one held in Russia, the other who disappeared during a reporting trip in Syria.

“Good journalism holds a mirror up to society,” he said. “We need you.”

Biden and Harris were seated at the head table along with other administration officials and the foreign leaders, plus Gridiron president Dan Balz of the Washington Post. Seated also at the table were Balz’s bosses, the Post’s Executive Editor Sally Buzbee and the newspaper’s owner, Jeff Bezos.

The dinner was held at the Grand Hyatt. No photos or TV were allowed.

"Joe Biden Is ‘Angry and Anxious’ About Lagging Reelection Campaign
",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/03/17/report-joe-biden-angry-anxious-lagging-reelection-campaign/,"Democrat President Joe Biden is “angry and anxious” about his struggling reelection campaign, NBC News reports.

Things are so bad inside the White House that, at one recent meeting where advisers informed Biden of his falling poll numbers in battleground states like Michigan and Georgia, Biden then began yelling and cursing at staffers.

“President Joe Biden was seething,” NBC’s Peter Nicholas, Courtney Kube, and Carol E. Lee wrote on Sunday. “In a private meeting at the White House in January, allies of the president had just told him that his poll numbers in Michigan and Georgia had dropped over his handling of the war between Israel and Hamas. Both are battleground states he narrowly won four years ago, and he can’t afford any backsliding if he is to once again defeat Donald Trump. He began to shout and swear, a lawmaker familiar with the meeting said. He believed he had been doing what was right, despite the political fallout, he told the group, according to the lawmaker.”

White House spokesman Andrew Bates told NBC News about the incident in January: “President Biden makes national security decisions based on the country’s national security needs alone — no other factor.”

But whatever spin the White House and Biden’s campaign puts on the situation, the facts are clear: Biden is losing this election right now. Biden has only fallen worse since January. Polls across nearly every battleground state show former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president in 2024 and Biden’s general election opponent, leading the current president significantly.

What’s more, Biden campaign officials this weekend elevated yet another fake attack on Trump, claiming Trump was calling for a “bloodbath” in America if he does not win in November. Biden’s campaign and top Democrats and their establishment media allies have used the term that Trump used at a campaign rally in Ohio this weekend to describe what would happen to the auto industry should Biden win as a bludgeon to bluntly push their contrived narrative that Trump represents a threat to democracy. This latest hoax has collapsed as fast as the Delawareans who created it could get it going, but it seems to signal a desperation from team Biden that nothing is breaking their way — and everything is going Trump’s way this year. Biden officials are constantly clamoring to get on offense and to put Trump on defense, but top allies of the Democrat president told NBC News they are running into a brick wall with voters.

Rep. Adam Smith (D-WA), for instance, is quoted in the story saying it is time for Biden to step up and prove he can lead the Democrat Party.

“Biden stood up in front of the whole world and said, ‘I’m ready. I’m the guy who can take down Donald Trump,’” Smith said. “So, he goddamn well better do it. We don’t have time for him to be worried about whether or not people are saying things right or the poll numbers are where they should be. I want focused energy and not defensive anger.”

Other Democrats like Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens and former Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA), while effusively praising Biden, seemed to strike the tone in quotes to the NBC News crew that they understand Democrats have not been effective in messaging on behalf of the administration and that the White House has done a poor job communicating what Biden’s team sees as wins on policy matters.

Some other anonymous Democrats are quoted too, suggesting that Biden is angry with himself for not being “more forceful” with White House staff.

“He’s probably a little mad at himself for not being more forceful with the staff,” one person said.

But top campaign advisers signaled to NBC News they are hopeful that now that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are hitting the campaign trail a bit more that things might turn around for them.

“The president and his advisers have all been eager for him to be out there more and planned for that to take place at the start of the election year, as has been the norm for past incumbents seeking re-election,” one person said.

Saturday, at a rally in Dayton, OH, Trump said, “If you’re listening, President Xi — and you and I are friends — but he understands the way I deal. Those big monster car manufacturing plants that you’re building in Mexico right now, and you think you’re going to get that, you’re going to not hire Americans, and you’re going to sell the cars as now we’re going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you’re not going to be able to sell those guys if I get elected. Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a bloodbath for the whole — That’s going to be the least of it. It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country.”

Anchor Jen Psaki said, “When you heard the full context and when you saw those comments at that rally, what did you hear?”

Tyler said, “What I heard was the same endorsement of political violence we have seen from Donald Trump for years, as you pointed out, and goes farther back. This is the same guy, after Nazis marched in Charlottesville, after they killed a woman, said there were fine people on both sides. This is the same guy who in 2020 told a white supremacists group, the Proud Boys to stand back and stand by. Now, every day on the stump he is championing and praising the insurrectionist will he encouraged to violently storm the Capitol in an attempt to overthrow our democracy.”

He added, “It is not simply one comment it exactly is who Donald Trump is and it is exactly the threat he poses to our democracy every day.”",3/17/2024,PAM KEY,BREITBART,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Mexico""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Biden campaign""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Dayton""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""OH""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Jen Psaki""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Michael Tyler""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Inside""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""MSNBC""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""bloodbath""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""President Xi""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Capitol""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Charlottesville""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Proud Boys""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""rally""}]",0.56
"Why are Black voters backing Donald Trump in record numbers?

Back in 2018, Hillary Clinton called former US President Donald Trump “ignorant” and “racist” after he reportedly made highly derogatory comments about Haiti and African countries.

Even Republican Nikki Haley, who recently dropped out of the race for the presidential nomination, called recent comments Trump made about African Americans “disgusting”.

But despite all this, and as the US prepares for a likely rematch between him and President Joe Biden in the 2024 presidential election later this year, polls show that Donald Trump is only growing in popularity among Black American voters.

Why is that, and how much of a difference could that make in November?

What do the polls say?
In 2016, Trump received 8 percent of the Black vote according to the exit polls, the highest level of support by Black voters for any Republican since George Bush in 2000. By the 2020 US presidential election, support for Trump among Black voters had surged to 12 percent.

And, while current opinion polls vary, a recent survey from GenForward shows that if the elections were held today, 17 percent of Black voters would vote for Donald Trump while 20 percent said they would vote for someone other than Trump or Biden.

The Black voting bloc is unique in the US. Currently, it is the only group of voters which has consistently identified with the Democrat Party – reaching 77 percent of Black voters in favour of Democrats in 2020. By comparison, 42 percent of white voters and 63 percent of Latino voters identify as Democrats. Now, however, only 63 percent of Black voters – an all-time low since GenForward started collecting data in 1999 – say they will support Biden this year, according to the survey.

These numbers could spell trouble for Democrats in November’s presidential election, especially in swing states.

What is the history of the Black vote?
To understand the history of the Black vote and the Republican Party, it is necessary to look back at voting patterns in the early 20th century.

Before the 1930s, the Republican and Democratic Parties received roughly equal support from both Black and White voters. The election of Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932, however, triggered a shift of Black voters to the Democratic Party. According to data from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Roosevelt gained 71 percent of the Black vote for his presidency in 1936. During the Great Depression, African Americans were disproportionally impacted by unemployment. Roosevelt’s New Deal, a set of economic recovery programmes attempted to correct these economic issues and Roosevelt would later say, “Among American citizens, there should be no forgotten men and no forgotten races.”

The Democrats would continue peeling away voters from the Republican Party in the late 1940s when Harry S Truman, another Democratic president, signed an executive order on July 26, 1948, ordering the desegregation of the US Armed Forces. This infuriated a cohort of the Democratic Party, known as the Dixiecrats, however, who were opposed to civil rights legislation and wanted to keep segregation in force in the southern states.

The Dixiecrats held a separate convention in Birmingham, Alabama in July 1948, at which they nominated South Carolina Governor Strom Thurmond, a staunch segregationist, for president on what they termed the “States’ Rights” ticket which called for the right to keep segregation. Although Thurmond won more than 1.1 million popular votes in the 1948 presidential election, this amounted to only 2.4 percent of votes cast and he was ultimately defeated by Truman, who won 303 electoral votes against Thurmond’s 39. Thomas Dewey, the Republican candidate, took 189.

The Democrats would further capture the Black vote in 1964 with the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 under Democratic President Lyndon B Johnson.

After signing the civil rights legislation into law, Johnson foresaw the backlash from the white Southern voting bloc when he famously said: “We’ve lost the South for a generation.”

Furthering the divide between the Black and white voting blocs, Richard Nixon, a Republican, deployed what was known at the time as the “Southern Strategy” during his presidential bids in 1968 and 1972. The strategy was designed to appeal to white voters in the South who were disenchanted with the Democratic Party’s stance on civil rights and racial integration.



How has this changed?
A Gallup poll last year showed that the proportion of Black adults in the US who consider themselves Democrats had decreased from 77 percent in 2020 to 66 percent.

Today’s Black voters operate a bit more independently from previous generations, especially young Black voters. In the 2022 midterm elections, Biden largely retained the Black vote, however, there was a considerable shift among Black voters towards the Republican Party – from 8 percent at the mid-terms four years previously to 14 percent in 2022.

Historically, the Democratic Party’s legacy with the Civil Rights Movement is what kept it popular with Black voters. However, younger Black voters do not have those same civil rights legacy attachments.

“I think a certain generation of Black voters don’t have the direct experience with the civil rights movement or the knowledge of those things, because to them that’s not memory, it’s history,” said Adolphus Belk, political scientist at Winthrop University. “They’re coming in without an understanding of these historical contours and turns, limitations, opportunities.

“And those frustrations are being made clear in this rising percentage of Black voters that’s taking a different look at the Republican Party in general, and are exploring some curiosities with Trump, despite his racial baggage.”

Furthermore, Black voters are frustrated that they are receiving little from the Democratic Party in return for what they feel is long-term, steadfast support, he said.

“White voters in general, white male voters most especially, are the greatest constituency that the Republican Party has and they tend to be treated well by the Republican Party. You don’t see that same sort of consistent celebration, respect for and rewarding of Black voters and Black women voters [by the Democratic party].”

Tim Scott

How is the ‘Trump-publican’ Party capitalising on this shift?
In October 2023, the New York Times/Siena College poll also found 22 percent of Black voters in six key battleground states supported Trump.

Trump is listening – Tim Scott, the only Black Republican senator, is reportedly on his shortlist for vice president candidates and has been singled out for praise by Trump. Scott, who dropped out of the race for the Republican presidential nomination last November, endorsed Trump in January.

However, some political analysts see his recent efforts to reach out to Black voters as being rife with stereotypical depictions of African Americans. At a recent gala hosted by the Black Conservative Federation (BCF) in Columbia, South Carolina, Trump said he believed he was receiving more Black support due to his four criminal cases because Blacks have been historically treated unfairly by the criminal justice system.

“And then I got indicted a second time and a third time and a fourth time. And a lot of people said that that’s why the Black people like me because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against,” he said. “They actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against.”

However, the BCF seemed unconcerned by criticism of Trump appearing to suggest he had a cultural connection with Black people when its official X account posted several days after the gala in defence of Trump.


Similar to the Democratic strategy in the mid-19th century, Trump is trying to pull away disaffected Black voters from the Democratic Party.

Trump has also claimed that Black Americans fared better economically under his presidency with record-low unemployment. Some experts have argued, however, that this was a continuation of a downward trend that started with the Obama administration.

"Trump predicts ‘bloodbath’ if he loses election and claims ‘Biden beat Obama’
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/17/trump-verbal-gaffes-ohio-rally-bloodbath,"Joe Biden tore into Donald Trump’s mental stability at a dinner in Washington DC on Saturday – just as the former president was making verbal gaffes at a campaign rally in Ohio as well as, during remarks on the economy and auto industry, predicting a “bloodbath” for the country if he met defeat in November’s election.

Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, confused the crowd at an appearance in Vandalia by insisting that Biden had beaten “Barack Hussein Obama” in elections nationally that never took place.

Freewheeling during a speech in which his teleprompters were seemingly disabled by high winds, Trump – a frequent critic of the 81-year-old Biden’s age and mental acuity – struggled to pronounce the words “bite” and “largest”. And he left the crowd scratching their heads over the reference to Obama, whom Biden served as vice-president from 2009 to 2017 before taking the Oval Office from Trump in 2020.

“You know what’s interesting? Joe Biden won against Barack Hussein Obama. Has anyone ever heard of him? Every swing state, Biden beat Obama but in every other state, he got killed,” Trump said.

Biden joked about Trump’s mental fitness at Saturday night’s Gridiron club dinner, a traditional “roast” attended by politicians and journalists dating to the 1880s.

“One candidate is too old and mentally unfit to be president. The other one is me,” the president said.

“Don’t tell him. He thinks he’s running against Barack Obama, that’s what he said,” Biden added, referring to several previous occasions when the 77-year-old Trump has confused the incumbent and presumptive 2024 opponent with his Democratic predecessor.

Trump’s Ohio address, ostensibly in support of Bernie Moreno, his preferred candidate in the state’s Republican Senate primary on Tuesday, also saw the former president returning to darker, more apocalyptic themes.

The US, Trump insisted during comments about the auto workers and the car industry, was headed for “a bloodbath” if he was rejected again at the polls in favor of Biden.

“Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s gonna be a bloodbath. That’s going to be the least of it. It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country,” he said, without clarifying what he meant.

Later, he added: “I don’t think you’re going to have another election in this country, if we don’t win this election … certainly not an election that’s meaningful.”

His comments prompted a statement from Biden’s re-election campaign that said “this is who Donald Trump is”.

A Biden campaign spokesperson James Singer said: “He wants another January 6, but the American people are going to give him another electoral defeat this November because they continue to reject his extremism, his affection for violence, and his thirst for revenge.”

Two Republicans who have been critical of Trump, however, came to his defense. The Louisiana senator Bill Cassidy told NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday: “You could also look at the definition of bloodbath and it could be an economic disaster. And so if he’s speaking about the auto industry, in particular in Ohio, then you can take it a little bit more context.”

Mike Pence, Trump’s former vice-president who this week refused to endorse his candidacy, made a similar argument. “[He] was clearly talking about the impact of imports devastating the American automotive industry,” Pence said on CBS’s Face the Nation.

Trump later claimed on his Truth Social platform that he “was simply referring to imports” allowed by Biden which the former president argued were “killing the automotive industry”. Additionally, Trump’s statement on Truth alluded to how the United Auto Workers’ “leadership” had endorsed Biden’s re-election campaign despite his boasts that car manufacturing would thrive “like never before” if he were chosen for a second presidency.

On Monday, Trump furthermore sent an email accusing those criticizing his bloodbath of lies while simultaneously appealing for donations to his campaign.

Also during his speech, repeating unsubstantiated claims that foreign countries were “emptying” their prisons and mental institutions into the US, Trump took a familiar swipe at immigrants, calling some of them “animals”.

“I don’t know if you call them people. They’re not people, in my opinion,” he said. “But I’m not allowed to say that because the radical left says that’s a terrible thing to say.”

Moreno, a Colombian immigrant who made a fortune from his car dealerships, joined in the nationalistic rhetoric, demanding that anybody who comes to the US learned to speak English.

“We don’t need to vote in five different languages. We learn the language,” he said. “It means you assimilate. You become part of America – America doesn’t become part of you.”

At other times during an often wild 90-minute address, Trump tossed out personal insults at political opponents. He called Biden “stupid” several times; made a vulgar reference to the first name of Fani Willis, the Georgia prosecutor in his criminal case for trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat; called the Democratic California governor, Gavin Newsom, “new-scum”; and attacked the personal appearance of JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, the New York Times reported.

He also attempted to blame the installation of the troublesome teleprompters on Biden, and he urged the event organizers not to pay the contractors.

Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic former US House speaker, condemned Trump’s comments during a Sunday appearance on CNN’s State of the Union.

“You wouldn’t even allow him in your house, much less in the White House,” she said.

“We just have to win this election, because he’s even predicting a bloodbath. What does that mean, he’s going to exact a bloodbath? There’s something wrong here. How respectful I am of the American people and their goodness, but how much more do they have to see from him to understand that this isn’t what our country is about?”

Biden echoed the warnings during the non-comedic section of his address to the Gridiron dinner, attended by more than 650 guests, continuing to refuse to use Trump’s name, and calling him only “my predecessor”.

“We live in an unprecedented moment in democracy,” Biden said. “An unprecedented moment for history. Democracy and freedom are literally under attack. [Russian president Vladimir] Putin’s on the march in Europe. My predecessor bows down to him and says to him, ‘do whatever the hell you want.’

“Freedom is under assault. The freedom to vote, the freedom to choose and so much more. The lies about the 2020 election, the plot to overturn it, to embrace the January 6 insurrection, pose the greatest threat to our democracy since the civil war.

"Biden signs new executive order to improve women’s health research as reproductive health remains central to reelection pitch
",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/18/politics/biden-executive-order-womens-health/index.html?iid=cnn_buildContentRecirc_end_recirc,"President Joe Biden is taking new executive action Monday to improve research on women’s health across the federal government as well as announce new actions being taken by several federal agencies as the White House seeks to increase funding for women’s health research.

While none of Monday’s actions are directly related to IVF research, the announcement comes as the Biden campaign has made reproductive health a focal point of his reelection campaign. Ever since Roe v. Wade was overturned, threats to abortion access and reproductive health have been animating voters critical to Democrats’ coalition.

Speaking to an audience gathered in the East Room of the White House for a reception marking Women’s History Month on Monday, Biden needled the efforts of former President Donald Trump and Republican members of Congress to restrict women’s access to health care, while vowing to reinstate Roe v. Wade as the law of the land if he’s reelected with a Democratic-controlled Congress.

“Our basic freedoms are under assault – the freedom to vote, freedom to choose and so much more,” Biden said. “My predecessor and his allies in Congress make no apologies for it, but here’s the deal: In the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court wrote, ‘Women are not without electoral and/or political power.’”

“No kidding!” the president added.

Biden’s new executive order Monday will integrate and prioritize women’s health across various federal agencies, fuel new research, and order the Office of Management and Budget and the Gender Policy Council to assess gaps in federal funding, according to the White House.

In addition to the executive order, Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden will be announcing over 20 actions or commitments being taken by several federal agencies. One of those efforts highlighted by the White House include a new effort from the National Institute of Health to direct “key investments” of $200 million to fund interdisciplinary women’s health research.

Biden made women’s reproductive rights a central pitch of his State of the Union address earlier this month - during which he urged Congress to pass $12 billion in new funding for women’s health research - and Vice President Kamala Harris has been traveling the country on a “Fight for Reproductive Freedoms” tour since late January.

That tour saw Harris visit a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota last week – historic because it was the first time a sitting president or vice president had visited an abortion provider.

She has also made stops in California, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Wisconsin.

Introducing Biden on Monday, Harris warned the country is facing “a full-on attack against hard-fought, hard-won freedoms and rights, including the rights of women to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.”

“Today in America, one-in-three women of reproductive age live in a state with an abortion ban,” she said, adding that she’s met “women who have had miscarriages in toilets because they were refused care” since Roe was overturned.

Nearly half of all registered voters in the United States say the November elections will have a “major impact” on abortion access, and 1 in 8 say the issue will be the most important driving factor motivating their vote, according to a KFF survey earlier this month.

The issue as a motivating factor for voters was sharpened after the Alabama Supreme Court last month ruled that frozen embryos were children, and that those who destroyed the embryos could be held liable for wrongful death. A new law passed by Alabama lawmakers has allowed IVF treatment to continue in the state after a panicked response by providers in the wake of the court decision.

The ruling caused even some of the most conservative members of Congress to move for legislation that would protect IVF, though House Speaker Mike Johnson said last week that the issue should be up to the states, not Congress.

“This is a huge opportunity for transformative change and will help improve the health and lives of women all across the country,” Dr. Carolyn Mazure, the chair of the White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, said in a call with reporters.

"The case for no candidate like Biden ever again
",https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/3/18/the-case-for-no-candidate-like-biden-ever-again,"The president’s track record of promoting corporate interests has contributed to the struggles of impoverished Americans.

The past three years of United States President Joe Biden’s administration have been perceived as an amazing success and dismal failure, depending on who you ask. Some see the successful rollout of COVID-19 vaccines, the economic recovery dubbed Bidenomics and the restoration of credibility to the executive branch as major accomplishments.

Others point to official rhetoric that downplays the devastating impact of COVID-19 subvariants and the end of pandemic mitigation measures and economic relief efforts, such as child allowances that helped reduce child poverty, as examples of the administration’s failure to confront immediate and long-term social and economic issues. Worse still, Biden’s declaration of unconditional support for Israel and his defence of its genocide along with the resurgence of naked white supremacy reflect the dominating atmosphere of Trumpism during his presidency.
In their decisions, Biden and his administration appear to be not all that dissimilar to their neoliberal and far-right predecessors spanning the past half-century from Richard Nixon to Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump.

No wonder many Americans lack enthusiasm for supporting a second Biden term. I am certainly among them. I will vote for Biden come November 5, but my vote will be with the sincere hope I will never have to cast another ballot for a politician who more than most has shaped the disastrous direction the federal government has taken over the past half-century.

As a registered Democrat since turning 18 in the late 1980s, I should be an avid supporter of the Democratic Party, Biden and his vice president, Kamala Harris. Thanks to them, all of my remaining student loan debt, which I began accumulating in 1987 as a college freshman and had been paying off since laying hands on my PhD diploma in 1997, no longer exists.

In August, I was one of 804,000 borrowers, whose student debt was erased as part of a student loan forgiveness initiative by the Department of Education. Debt worth tens of thousands of dollars – all compound interest on my original principal of $41,300 – was gone. As of December, the Biden administration has forgiven $132bn in loans for 3.6 million borrowers.

Admittedly, I was ecstatic. At first. Then I experienced a few days of sighs of relief, an occasional tear and, later, a bit of anger.

It was debt I had struggled to repay for decades and couldn’t discharge in a bankruptcy as a result of legislation that Biden, as a senator, had spent years lobbying for on behalf of banks and credit companies. When passed in 2005, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act closed the bankruptcy option for student loan borrowers.

It was debt I had accumulated while completing my three degrees because financial support through federal grants was limited. That was due to amendments to the Higher Education Act that Biden had also supported and that expanded student loans as the primary method to pay for tuition for first-generation students from families living in poverty.

While in college, I received the Pell Grant, a federal government subsidy for low-income students, which at that time was about $2,200 per year. It covered only about 17 percent of my total college expenses at the University of Pittsburgh and only about 29 percent of my out-of-state tuition. Even with me working all through my undergraduate years – including a year where I averaged 30 hours a week as a work-study student – I still had to take out $16,000 in student loans. That was just for my bachelor’s degree.
Today’s Pell Grants cover less than 30 percent of college expenses at public higher education institutions, leading to more borrowing and more risks and limitations for low-income students once they earn their degrees.

As of last fall, more than 43 million borrowers owed more than $1.75 trillion on student loans. Biden’s sponsorship of student loan programmes, his support for the slow rise of Pell Grant allotments lagging behind tuition increases and his standing against student loan borrowers seeking relief through bankruptcy have been part of efforts to defund need-based aid over four decades.

That the president is now trying to undo some of the damage to the lives of tens of millions of Americans in no way makes up for his role in creating this crisis in the first place. Nor should it mean that any borrower who has benefitted should automatically grant him their vote.

I think about what could have and should have been. Every decision I made in my education had to factor in how much more I would need to borrow to complete my degree. Every decision I came to had to account for this question: Can I afford to pay off these loans?

Decisions like whether I should continue to major in a practical field like computer science or switch to history, a subject I enjoyed and had an affinity for. Or whether I should take time off from school to work and figure out what I really wanted to do as a writer or just pass go and earn my master’s degree and doctorate while still in my mid-20s.

Or what jobs should I say yes or no to, especially with the conundrum of finding ethical work in social justice or in education versus work merely to pay my student loans and bills, eventual car notes and maybe a mortgage. Or whether I should stay in Pittsburgh with its low and stagnant wages but also low cost of living or move to the Washington, DC, area, one of the most expensive places to live in the US but with higher earning potential.

And whether and when to buy a house, rent a house or rent an apartment, when to have a kid, when to buy a car, whether and when to leave a job for something slightly better. These were among the many debt-ridden questions and decisions I have faced.

Despite my degrees and my middle-class-level income since 1999, I became overwhelmed and ended up declaring bankruptcy on my consumer loan debt in 2011. That still did not remove my obligation to pay my student loans, thanks again to Biden’s work on behalf of banking lobbyists in 2005.

Whether fully employed or underemployed, I kept paying or making arrangements to pay. For 25 years, I kept paying, from November 1997 until the student loan pause hit for me in July 2022, some $67,000 in payments in all. The pandemic pause for student loan payments enacted in 2020 did not initially apply to me because I had originally consolidated all of my student loans.

Being able to pay on my loans at a lower interest rate could have helped me save more money for my son to attend college. It could have been the down payment for a new home. But not having to borrow at all could have made the difference between having a successful writing career in my late 20s and 30s instead of my mid-40s and 50s.

Just on the issue of student loan debt alone, Biden’s body of work represents the past 50 years of economic stagnation and the rise of the super wealthy at the expense of the struggling American middle class and the expansion of poverty in the US.  With friends like Biden, a Democrat working hand-in-hand with Republicans to keep millions of people locked in debt for decades, who needs enemies?

Both parties cost me a decade to 15 years of lost income, lost sleep and lost opportunities for a quality of life I can now enjoy with nearly all of my youthful years behind me. I will only vote for Biden in November because the alternative is even worse. I will do so to buy time for a future without politicians like Biden compromising my life chances away.

Kennedy Family Makes St. Patrick's Day Visit To The White House Without RFK Jr.,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/kennedy-family-white-house-without-robert-f-kennedy-jr_n_65f85ddbe4b0defe9b27cc03,"When the Kennedy family visited the White House this St. Patrick’s Day, one notable person was missing.

Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not join fellow members of the Irish American political dynasty for a photo op with President Joe Biden on Sunday.

Signaling the family’s support for the Democratic incumbent, and not Kennedy’s independent campaign for president, his sister Kerry Kennedy posted a photo of the president and dozen of Kennedys to X and wrote, “President Biden, you make the world better. Happy St. Patrick’s Day.”

Biden responded, saying, “From one proud Irish family to another — it was good to have you all back at the White House.”


While Sunday’s meeting with Biden wasn’t a direct condemnation of RFK, four of his siblings Kerry, Rory Kennedy, Joseph P. Kennedy II and Kathleen Kennedy Townsend publicly denounced his candidacy in a searing statement last fall.

“The decision of our brother Bobby to run as a third party candidate against Joe Biden is dangerous to our country,” it began.

“Bobby might share the same name as our father, but he does not share the same values, vision or judgment,” the statement went on. “Today’s announcement is deeply saddening for us. We denounce his candidacy and believe it to be perilous for our country.”

The second-born son of late politician Robert F. Kennedy, RFK Jr. has tried to draw from his family’s name and legacy to legitimize a campaign chock full of fringe views.

"Biden campaign reveals 'aggressive' swing state strategy, admits beating Trump will 'take relentless effort'",https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-campaign-reveals-aggressive-swing-state-strategy-admits-beating-trump-relentless-effort,"EXCLUSIVE: President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris' re-election campaign has revealed its ongoing, ""aggressive"" strategy to gain the advantage in critical swing states ahead of the November general election, telling Fox News Digital it will ""take relentless effort"" to defeat former President Trump.

Speaking with Fox amid a cross-country tour that will culminate in the president visiting all six of the states in which he narrowly defeated Trump in 2020, Biden-Harris communications director Michael Tyler touted the hawkish approach being taken by the campaign following the president's fiery State of the Union speech earlier this month.

""We knew kicking off the year we wanted to have an aggressive posture going into 2024. That's why the president began the year with speeches in places like Valley Forge and in Charleston, where he laid out what this election was going to be about,"" Tyler said.

""Looking ahead to March, we knew we had tentpole moments like Super Tuesday, and State of the Union, where, in the minds of the American electorate, the general election was really going to kick off,"" he added. 

The day after his State of the Union speech — which avoided any major gaffes Republicans often point to as evidence of cognitive decline — Biden hit the campaign trail with a stop in Philadelphia, followed by another in Atlanta the next day. 

Stops in Wisconsin and Michigan followed on Thursday, with more planned in Nevada and Arizona this week, all an effort to demonstrate what Tyler described as ""defining the choice"" voters have this November. ""Joe Biden, who wakes up every single day fighting for the American people, bringing people together to get results, and Donald Trump, who is running a campaign of revenge and retribution, and is focused on himself.""

""This is, of course, going to be a very, very competitive general election contest, as all presidential elections are. But we feel good about where we're at, just given some of the key metrics. And if you look at which candidate is fully consolidating their base of support, Joe Biden is doing that throughout the primary contest, while Donald Trump continues to hit a ceiling in proving an inability to expand beyond the MAGA base,"" Tyler said.

Concern over Trump's ability to coalesce the various factions of the Republican Party behind his candidacy has continued to grow following former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley's departure from the race the morning after Super Tuesday.

Despite suspending her campaign, Haley still received more than 13% of the vote in Georgia's primary last week, although it is unclear how much of that was early or absentee votes cast before she dropped out.

Recent polls have also suggested large portions of voters who supported Haley in other states were motivated by their opposition to Trump, and that they might not shift their support to him as the Republican nominee. 

That does not mean those voters would automatically show up to support Biden, but, as Fox News contributor and Republican strategist Karl Rove said amid Super Tuesday's results being tallied, ""Team Trump ought to be concerned about unifying the Republican Party.""

""I just think the ability to expand beyond the MAGA base, look at which candidate is amassing the financial resources and building the infrastructure needed to reach the voters who are going to decide this election — Joe Biden is doing that. Donald Trump is not,"" Tyler said, referencing the massive cash advantage the campaign, in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee, holds over their Republican rivals.

""We have $130 million in the bank to wage this general election fight, while Donald Trump is … either spending money up to this stage in the race fending off Nikki Haley or spending money on legal fees. None of the money that he's spending so far is geared towards reaching the voters that are going to, again, decide the pathway to 270 electoral votes in the general election,"" he added.

According to FEC filings, the $50 million spent by Trump's fundraising entities on his legal defense last year goes up to north of $90 million if spending in 2022 and 2021 is included. Combining that with Trump's fundraising costs — which reach nearly half of the $282 million he's raised — his cash burn rate amounts to a whopping 81%, leaving him just $0.19 per dollar raised.

""He's spending that money screaming into an echo chamber of MAGA extremism. And I think the most important thing is which candidate is running on an agenda that's actually popular with the American people, and with a proven track record of delivering results for the American people,"" Tyler said. 

WHO IS NEW TRUMP-BACKED RNC CHAIRMAN MICHAEL WHATLEY?

""Joe Biden is clearly doing that, running on a historic record of accomplishment, and running on an agenda that is very popular, versus Donald Trump, who is running on an agenda that is even more extreme than the one that he governed on when he had power, and that he campaigned on in 2020. It's as dangerous as it is extreme this go around in 2024,"" he said.

When asked if he felt Biden — who has trailed Trump in recent swing state polls — could get a boost from the former president possibly being required to attend court rather than be on the campaign trail, Tyler did not concede that any aspect of the race would be made easier.

""I think it's going to take a relentless effort on behalf of this campaign to reach the voters,"" he said. ""We are running on a popular historic record of accomplishment. It is about us doing the work to communicate with the voters who are going to decide this election everything this administration has done to make their lives better over the last four years."" 

""The more that the American people hear about Joe Biden's record of accomplishment, his positive vision for the future, and the more that they hear about the danger and the extremism that is posed by Donald Trump, the more they're going to side with Joe Biden over the course of the next eight months,"" he said. 


Tyler dismissed any notion that the campaign's aggressive posture was part of an effort to push back on concerns about Biden's age and cognitive ability, but rather about ""aggressively campaigning, and aggressively contrasting what this election is actually going to be about.""

""The president himself has said this is not going to be a contrast in age. It's going to be a contrast in the age of the candidates' ideas,"" he said. 

""Donald Trump's ideas are old as hell, and they've already been rejected by the American people. And so, Joe Biden is going to aggressively make sure that we reject Trump's ideas for good, and that we continue to pursue a more positive vision for what this country can achieve if we all work together,"" he added.

"Trump says Jewish Democrats ‘hate’ their religion and Israel
",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/18/donald-trump-jewish-voters/,"Former president Donald Trump again claimed that the Democratic Party “hates Israel” and that Jewish Americans who vote for Democrats “hate” their religion, echoing previous attacks he has made about Jewish Democrats.
“I think they hate Israel,” Trump said of Democrats. He then said that Democrats “see a lot of votes” among Americans who oppose the Israel-Gaza war. The comments were part of a lengthy interview with far-right former adviser Sebastian Gorka that was posted online Monday.

“Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion,” Trump added.

Trump made the comments in response to a question from Gorka about Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer’s call last week for a “new election” in Israel.

Schumer (D-N.Y.), the highest-ranking Jewish official in the United States and a staunch ally of Israel, said on the Senate floor Thursday that he thinks Israelis understand “better than anybody that Israel cannot hope to succeed as a pariah opposed by the rest of the world” and would choose better leaders if an election were held.

Schumer suggested that Israel hold a new election “once the war starts to wind down” to allow its citizens to “express their vision for the postwar future.” He said that the outcome would be up to the Israelis — not Americans. But many Republicans took Schumer’s words as an attack on Israel, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) describing the call for a new election as “grotesque.”



Trump, in his interview with Gorka, went on a lengthy rant about the Democratic Party and Jewish Democrats. Doubling down on his attack on Schumer, the former president claimed that the Senate majority leader “was always pro-Israel” but that he’s “very anti-Israel now.”

“When you see those Palestinian marches, even I am amazed at how many people are in those marches,” Trump said. “And guys like Schumer see that, and to him it’s votes.”

In a post Monday on X, Schumer said that making “Israel a partisan issue only hurts Israel and the US-Israeli relationship.”

“Trump is making highly partisan and hateful rants,” he said. “I am working in a bipartisan way to ensure the US-Israeli relationship sustains for generations to come, buoyed by peace in the Middle East.”

Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, criticized Trump’s remarks.

“Accusing Jews of hating their religion because they might vote for a particular party is defamatory and patently false,” he said in a statement. “Serious leaders who care about the historic US-Israel alliance should focus on strengthening, rather than unraveling, bipartisan support for the State of Israel.”

In a statement to The Washington Post, White House spokesman Andrew Bates said there is “no justification for spreading toxic, false stereotypes that threaten fellow citizens. None.”

“Like President Biden said, he was moved to run for President when he saw Neo Nazis chanting ‘the same Antisemitic bile that was heard in Germany in the 1930s’ in Charlottesville,” Bates added. “Leaders have an obligation to call hate what it is and bring Americans together against it.”

Trump’s campaign doubled down on its candidate’s criticisms, attacking the Biden administration’s policies, Democrats in Congress that have signed petitions and Schumer’s remarks.

“President Trump is right — the Democrat Party has turned into a full-blown anti-Israel, anti-Semitic, pro-terrorist cabal,” Karoline Leavitt, the campaign’s national press secretary, said in a statement.

This is not the first time Trump has targeted Jewish Democrats.

On the final day of Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year celebration, Trump claimed last year that “liberal Jews” who didn’t support him were voting “to destroy America & Israel.”

In March 2019, he falsely said the Democratic Party is “anti-Israel” and “anti-Jewish.” Later that year, he tried to brand the Democratic Party as antisemitic by claiming that voters who support Democrats were being “very disloyal to Israel and to the Jewish people.”

His use of the word “disloyalty” immediately drew criticism from Jewish groups that said Trump was echoing antisemitic tropes about where American Jews’ loyalty lies. Trump insisted then that his comments were not antisemitic.

Trump has repeatedly voiced his frustration over his unpopularity among Jewish voters, a bloc that supported Biden over Trump 70 percent to 27 percent in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center’s validated voter survey.

A different Pew poll conducted last month found that 79 percent of Jewish Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, while 62 percent were favorable toward Biden. That same poll found that 35 percent of American Jews said Trump stands up for people with religious beliefs similar to theirs at least some of the time, while 59 percent said he does this “a little” or not at all.",3/18/2024,Mariana Alfaro,Washington Post,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Senate""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Sebastian Gorka""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Israel-Gaza war""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""election""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""United States""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""war""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Palestinian marches""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Charles E.

"Biden-Trump rematch dread verges on denial for some voters
",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/18/biden-trump-election-rematch/,"President Biden and former president Donald Trump have been running for 11 and 16 months, respectively. Biden never had a serious challenger in the Democratic primary and has easily won in every state. Trump consistently led other Republicans in polls, with a widening advantage since he started facing indictments in four cases, and won everywhere except Vermont and D.C. Last Tuesday, both accrued enough pledged delegates to secure their party’s nominations, setting up a rematch in November.

Some Americans aren’t buying it.

In surveys, focus groups and interviews, some voters are expressing doubts that the presumptive nominees will in fact be the nominees. In a Monmouth University national poll conducted last month, almost half of voters said it was “very” or “somewhat” likely that Biden would be replaced as the Democratic nominee by November, and about a third said the same of Trump. An Economist/YouGov survey taken as both candidates clinched their nominations found 33 percent of Americans thought a Biden-Trump rematch would “definitely” happen, 44 percent said it would probably happen, and the rest were less certain.

“I think there’s still time,” said Alfonso Ramirez, a 56-year-old independent voter in Glendale, Ariz., who was holding out hope for a different Democrat but would choose Trump in a rematch. “Uno nunca sabe,” he added in Spanish, meaning, “You never know.”


Those doubts are another unusual feature of this year’s presidential campaign: a rematch between two presidents, both effectively running as incumbents within their parties, and both historically unpopular. In the Economist/YouGov poll, 54 percent said they viewed Biden unfavorably and the same percentage did not want him to run again, compared to 50 percent on both questions for Trump.

For some, that dissatisfaction crosses over into disbelief.

“How can he even run with that hanging over his head?” an undecided voter named Linda from Wisconsin said of Trump’s indictments in a January focus group conducted by the firm GBAO for the Democratic group Navigator Research. “I’m hoping these aren’t the two candidates, but I’m afraid they are. One’s older than the other, one’s more senile than the other. It scares me.”

Navigator’s senior director, Bryan Bennett, said voters who support Biden are more convinced he’ll be the nominee, while those who disapprove are less sure. Bennett attributed this “believability gap” to denial among left-leaning and moderate young Americans, and another way for conservatives to express disapproval of the president.

But some voters’ doubts stem from genuine uncertainties in an unprecedented and unpredictable election year. In follow-up questions for the Monmouth survey, voters who thought the nominees would be replaced before November provided reasons such as Biden’s age (81), physical or mental health, and for Trump, his criminal charges or health (he is 77).

Some voters have expressed misperceptions of Trump’s legal problems as they explained their disbelief that he is running.

“Personally, I thought Trump was still in jail, so this is news to me,” a voter named Rhea said in a Navigator focus group from November. “It’s mind-blowing that he has charges against him and he’s still running.”

Biden’s doctor has released a report saying he is fit to serve. But polls show persistent concerns about his age and mental sharpness. In interviews and focus groups, many voters have winced at Biden’s verbal stumbles and voiced discomfort about his age.

“I just have this terrible picture of a marginally senile Biden getting up there and saying, ‘Hey guys, you’re right. I need a break from all this,’” a two-time Trump voter named Paul from Ohio said in another focus group conducted by Republican Voters Against Trump.

Such concerns about Biden’s health or stamina reflect the impact of Republican attacks portraying him as feeble and declining. Trump (who sometimes trips up his own words) has stoked questions about Biden’s future on the Democratic ticket with asides such as “I don’t think that Biden will make it to the gate,” in a December interview with the far-right website Breitbart. An ad this month from the main pro-Trump super PAC questioned Biden’s longevity and ended on a clip of Vice President Harris laughing. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.

“This is a very, very unique election,” said John McLaughlin, a pollster for the Trump campaign. “Definitely more than usual think something could happen to Biden’s health, and Harris would be president. Then there are those voters who think Biden wants to put Trump in jail.”

Researchers in both parties say dread about the election, along with more generalized exhaustion with politics and news, is causing many voters to tune out. The Biden campaign has made that part of its case to explain how it will overcome the president’s poor performance in approval ratings and head-to-head polls, arguing that voters will return to Biden once they start facing the reality of a second Trump administration.

“That choice is no longer hypothetical,” Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa said. “President Biden looks forward to spending the next eight months reminding the American people how dangerous Donald Trump and his extremist agenda are.”

Unlike in most elections, where campaigns get an opportunity to introduce their candidate to voters, both candidates this year are already almost universally well known — and predominantly disliked. An unusually large group of voters say they have unfavorable views of Biden and Trump: 19 percent in a February New York Times-Siena College poll. Such “double negative” or “double haters” supported Biden over Trump 45 percent to 33 percent — which researchers say could be a leading indicator.

“A similar number of voters on both sides are showing consistent fatigue and disinterest and dissatisfaction with politics in general,” said Matt Canter, a partner at the Democratic polling firm Global Strategy Group. “The electorate is going to be slower to engage, but there is a lot of Trump amnesia and that presents a real opportunity for the Biden campaign because voters aren’t paying attention, and as voters begin to pay attention, there’s a lot about Trump that’s going to become front and center that they wont like.”",3/18/2024,Isaac Arnsdorf and Sabrina Rodriguez,Washington Post,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""D.C.""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""focus groups""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Vermont""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Linda""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Wisconsin""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Glendale""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Democratic primary""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Monmouth University""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""presidential campaign""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Ariz.""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Alfonso Ramirez""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrat""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Economist/YouGov""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""focus group""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democratic""}]",0.51
"Marlow: Media Is ‘Lying,’ Trump’s Bloodbath Comments Were About the Auto Industry
",https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2024/03/18/marlow-media-is-lying-trumps-bloodbath-comments-were-about-the-auto-industry/,"Breitbart Editor-in-Chief and New York Times bestselling Breaking Biden author Alex Marlow said Monday on “America First” podcast that the media were “lying” about former President Donald Trump’s bloodbath comments.

Saturday, at a rally in Dayton, OH, Trump said, “If you’re listening, President Xi — and you and I are friends — but he understands the way I deal. Those big monster car manufacturing plants that you’re building in Mexico right now, and you think you’re going to get that, you’re going to not hire Americans, and you’re going to sell the cars as now we’re going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes across the line, and you’re not going to be able to sell those guys if I get elected. Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a bloodbath for the whole — That’s going to be the least of it. It’s going to be a bloodbath for the country.”

Marlow said, “I thought I burned out on MSNBC because they are so obvious about what they are trying to do but I find in an election year I’m going over there more often to see what they are up to, to see what talking points they are on. The bloodbath talking point is a perfect example of what we are in for for the the rest of the year because it is so clear from the context that Trump was talking specifically about job losses in the auto industry which is objectively true. The Democratic Party and Joe Biden wants to focus on EVs which are made largely in China and a lot of the components are made in China and he wants to focus on combustion engine cars which are made in America.”

He added, “This is a blatant lie. Trump was only talking about auto industry jobs anyone who tells you otherwise is a liar lying straight yo your face.

"Trump Sues ABC After Host Accuses Him Of 'Rape' In E. Jean Carroll Assault Case
",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-sues-abc-after-host-accuses-him-of-rape-in-e-jean-carroll-assault-case_n_65f9a004e4b03f22de60bc27,"Donald Trump on Monday filed a lawsuit against ABC News and George Stephanopoulos, claiming the anchor defamed the former president by saying he’d “raped” E. Jean Carroll instead of sexually assaulting her.

Stephanopoulos used the term several times in an interview earlier this month with Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.), where he asked her how she could defend a man who’d been found liable for rape.

“Judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape and for defaming the victim of that rape,” he said at one point. “How do you square your endorsement of Donald Trump with the testimony we just saw?”

The South Carolina Republican, who said she was raped at the age of 16, responded by calling the question “offensive” and accused the anchor of trying to “shame” her.

She also noted that Trump was found liable for sexual abuse ― not rape ― and that the charges were civil in nature, not criminal.

That point looms heavy in the 20-page complaint, which alleges Stephanopoulos “maliciously intended to convince his viewers ... that [Trump] had been found liable of rape.”

The suit requests judgment for “damages, punitive damages, court costs, and such other relief as the Court deems just and proper,” but doesn’t spell out a specific amount.

“Mr. Trump in fact did 'rape' Ms. Carroll as that term commonly is used and understood in contexts outside of the New York Penal Law.""”

- District Judge Lewis Kaplan
An ABC News spokesperson declined to comment to HuffPost.

Trump’s legal team is hinging their case against ABC on something of a technicality, as New York state law narrowly defines “rape” as nonconsensual penile penetration. Trump was found by a civil court last year to have assaulted Carroll in a department store dressing room, forcibly penetrating her vagina with his fingers. But the court did not rule that the allegations met that more specific definition of rape.

Still, in an August 2023 filing, District Judge Lewis Kaplan clarified that those findings don’t mean Trump didn’t “rape” her per se.

“Based on all of the evidence at trial and the jury’s verdict as a whole, the jury’s finding that Mr. Trump ‘sexually abused’ Ms. Carroll implicitly determined that he forcibly penetrated her digitally,” Kaplan wrote.

“In other words, [Trump] in fact did ‘rape’ Ms. Carroll as that term commonly is used and understood in contexts outside of the New York Penal Law.”

A New York jury ordered Trump to pay Carroll $5 million in damages last May. Trump then proceeded to defame Carroll over the case, leading to a separate $83.3 million in damages in January and a promise by Carroll to “absolutely” sue Trump again should he continue to defame her.",3/19/2024,Ryan Grenoble,huffpost,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Nancy Mace""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""South Carolina""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""E.

"Joe Biden Puts Trump On Blast in Ominous New 'Bloodbath' Attack Ad
",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/joe-biden-trump-bloodbath_n_65f930dbe4b0cb9583b16ebd,"President Joe Biden’s campaign wasted no time turning Donald Trump’s latest comments against him in a new attack ad.

The spot, released on Biden’s X feed, highlights Trump’s speech this weekend warning of a “bloodbath” if he loses November’s election. Then, it cuts to footage of the infamous 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, where Trump claimed there were “very fine people on both sides.”

The new ad also shows Trump saluting the Jan. 6, 2021, rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to keep him in power, as well as his vow to pardon them:


Trump’s campaign has claimed he meant an economic “bloodbath” when he used the term at an Ohio rally.

Biden Jokes About Trump Struggling to Pay Massive New York Fine,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/03/19/biden-jokes-about-trump-struggling-to-pay-massive-new-york-fine/,"President Joe Biden joked at the Gridiron Dinner this past weekend about former President Donald Trump’s struggle to pay nearly half a billion dollars in fines resulting from a controversial civil fraud judgement against him in New York.

New York Attorney General Letitia James (D) — who ran for office specifically promising to use the law to pursue Trump for unspecified sins — declared that “everyone must play by the same rules,” though the Trump case was unprecedented.

Trump was sued for allegedly inflating his net worth under a New York law that does not require the state to show intent, and in which the banks he supposedly defrauded said they had not lost any money on loans given to him.

The Democrat judge, Arthur Engoron, delivered a summary judgment against Trump that denied him the opportunity to mount a defense. Now, Trump is scrambling to find a way to pay the $464 million judgment — including interest.

The former president was able to obtain financing for a bond for the more than $90 million he was ordered to pay writer E. Jean Carroll in a separate New York case, over claims of sexual assault and defamation, pending his appeal.

But Trump has been unable to find insurance companies willing to underwrite the massive bond necessary for the bond in the fraud case, meaning that he may have to sell some of his real estate holdings at discounted “fire sale” prices.

Biden — or his speechwriters — thought this was good fodder for a joke at the Gridiron Dinner, despite the fact that his son faces criminal (not civil) charges for his own financial dealings, which allegedly also benefited Biden himself.

Biden said:

Our big plan to cancel student debt doesn’t apply to everyone. Just yesterday, a defeated-looking man came up to me and said, “I’m being crushed by debt. I’m completely wiped out.” I said, “Sorry, Donald, I can’t help you.” (Laughter and applause.)

Trump must pay the bond even if he wins on appeal, meaning he could suffer financial losses despite being innocent. Fox News’ Charlie Gasparino told Neil Cavuto on Your World on Tuesday afternoon that forcing Trump to sell a large portion of his real estate portfolio to pay the bond could have an effect on the commercial real estate market in New York City, which is already struggling to recover from the pandemic, crime, and high-tax policies.

*** Election Night Livewire *** Trump-Backed Bernie Moreno Seeks to Crush Establishment GOP in Ohio,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/03/19/election-night-livewire-trump-backed-bernie-moreno-seeks-crush-establishment-gop-ohio/,"Former President Donald Trump already has the GOP nomination for president this year locked up, but he faces a key test of his intra-GOP strength as his pick for U.S. Senate in Ohio, businessman and political outsider Bernie Moreno, faces off against two far more establishment GOP candidates in state Sen. Matt Dolan and Secretary of State Frank LaRose.

Moreno has been running a campaign focused on deporting illegal aliens who entered the country during Democrat President Joe Biden’s administration and opposing sending more U.S. tax dollars overseas to be wasted by the Ukrainians in their war against Russia. Dolan, meanwhile, is a globalist establishment Republican who supports more Ukraine aid, and LaRose has been grilled for taking funding from leftist sources, including accepting cash from Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg to run elections in Ohio and accepting money from LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman.

Moreno has been fighting off vicious media attacks from the Associated Press in the final days of the campaign, and Trump stumped for him on Saturday with a massive rally in Dayton, Ohio. Whoever wins this race could determine a lot about the future of the GOP, and where things go from here.

Other states are having some primaries of note as well, with Illinois seeing two different sitting congressmen–a Republican and a Democrat–facing aggressive primary challenges. Rep. Mike Bost (R-IL) seeks to fend off conservative challenger Darren Bailey while Rep. Danny Davis (D-IL)–an 82-year-old longtime Democrat lawmaker–faces two serious challengers.

Out in California, too, voters will vote in a special election to choose who will succeed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy in his old Bakersfield-area House seat. Other states, including Florida, have presidential primaries on Tuesday but since the GOP and Democrat primaries have been decided — as Trump and Biden both have locked down the majority of delegates ahead of their respective conventions this summer — these are essentially perfunctory exercises. However, there may be interesting data points to glean from turnout numbers or vote totals and demographics that provide clues for what might happen in November’s general election.

Polls in Ohio close at 7:30 p.m. ET, and later in other states. Follow along here on Breitbart News for live results, breaking news, and analysis throughout the evening.

UPDATE 10:18 p.m. ET:

Moreno has now reached 50 percent statewide with 83 percent reporting. His lead is more than 17 points.
UPDATE 10:15 p.m. ET:

Donald Trump Jr., another key player in Moreno’s victory who barnstormed Ohio multiple times with him, weighs in congratulating him as well and putting the heat on Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) for November:


UPDATE 10:13 p.m. ET:

Moreno is now on track to win every county in Ohio as he just overtook Dolan in his home county of Cuyahoga in the Cleveland area. He’s also now at 49.8 percent statewide on the cusp of majority support.

UPDATE 10:12 p.m. ET:

Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), who was a huge part of Moreno’s victory, weighs in by noting he was outspent and outgunned but proved his mettle by working hard to get Trump’s endorsement and then winning over Ohio GOP voters to get the nomination:


UPDATE 9:58 p.m. ET:

Moreno now has overtaken Dolan in all but two counties with clear pathways to do so in both of those counties as well.

UPDATE 9:54 p.m. ET:

Moreno’s lead keeps expanding even more. He’s at 49.6 percent to Dolan’s 32.9 percent. That means he’s leading by nearly 17 percent now. He’s also close to majority territory too. With just 71 percent reporting at this point, Moreno could easily eclipse the majority threshold and keep expanding his already-secure victory.

What’s more, Moreno leads in every Ohio county except four of them, with pathways to win every county in the state. This is an absolutely dominating performance by the Trump-backed candidate and an extremely strong evening for Moreno and for Trump heading into the general election.

UPDATE 9:15 p.m. ET:

The Senate Leadership Fund, a group controlled by Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell, issued a statement congratulating Moreno on his victory. “Senate Leadership Fund congratulates Bernie Moreno on his hard-fought victory in the Ohio Senate Republican primary,” SLF president Steven Law said. “Republicans are united behind Bernie and committed to defeating left-wing career politician Sherrod Brown this November. We know Bernie will run an aggressive campaign to win.”

UPDATE 8:56 p.m. ET:

With just 33 percent reporting, Moreno’s lead is massively expanding. Yes, the race has already been called and he won big, but this could be historic level blowout material. Moreno is at 45.2 percent to Dolan’s 34.8 percent. That’s already a more than double digit lead, and plenty of room for Moreno to expand it. Talk about an embarrassment for the failed GOP old guard establishment.

UPDATE 8:49 p.m. ET:

The irony of the AP having to call this race is not lost on many Moreno and Trump supporters:


UPDATE 8:47 p.m. ET:

The GOP is quickly unifying behind Moreno after his landslide victory:


UPDATE 8:39 p.m. ET:

Well, it’s official now, the Associated Press has called it:


Moreno won. The establishment got smoked. Trump wins again. And of course given the attack piece the organization published against Moreno last week, the Associated Press is hardest hit. The failed fake news media fails again.

UPDATE 8:36 p.m. ET:

Others are noticing the same thing that Decision Desk HQ has:


UPDATE 8:34 p.m. ET:

Decision Desk HQ projects that Bernie Moreno has won the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in Ohio:


More calls from other outlets will likely be forthcoming soon.

UPDATE 8:31 p.m. ET:

Now, Moreno is really beginning to pull away. With 22 percent reporting, Moreno is at 40.4 percent while Dolan is down at 37.3 percent. Things are looking terrible for the establishment old guard of the GOP.

UPDATE 8:25 p.m. ET:

With 21 percent reporting, Moreno has now expanded his lead to more than a percent. Moreno is at 39.2 percent and Dolan is down at 38.1 percent. Things could be heading for a pretty early call for Ohio standards.

UPDATE 8:22 p.m. ET:

Betting markets have swung massively in Moreno’s direction, with him heavily, heavily favored to win.

UPDATE 8:16 p.m. ET:

Still just 19 percent reporting but Moreno is back in front by a fraction of a percent.

UPDATE 8:15 p.m. ET:

With 19 percent in now, less than 100 votes separate Dolan from Moreno as Moreno has essentially again erased Dolan’s lead. This is mostly early votes from around the state so if Moreno wins election day numbers as expected this is going to be huge for him.

UPDATE 8:11 p.m. ET:

With 17 percent reporting now, Dolan has crept back in front with 38.97 percent to Moreno’s 38.35 percent. Again, the road is running out for Dolan with the election day turnout beginning to come in and crush him. If the current trend lines hold, this will be a big night for Moreno and Trump.

UPDATE 8:01 p.m. ET:

Now, with 13 percent reporting, Moreno is back in front and expanding his lead. Moreno is at 38.52 percent and Dolan is down at 37.95 percent.

UPDATE 7:59 p.m. ET:

Dolan is back in front with 11 percent reporting, but Moreno is far outperforming what most expected and Dolan is far underperforming what most expected when it comes to the early returns. It’s still too early to call, but things are looking great for Moreno right now.

UPDATE 7:54 p.m. ET:

With 10 percent reporting now, Moreno has taken the lead over Dolan. This looks terrible for the establishment. Moreno is at 38.18 percent and Dolan is at 38.04 percent. What remains to be counted is likely to be very Moreno-heavy.

 UPDATE 7:51 p.m. ET:

The GOP establishment really went all out to try to stop Moreno. Assuming he ends up pulling this off, it’ll be a total failure of the big special interest moneyed donor class and a win for the little guys. An Ohio source sent this spending analysis to Breitbart News that shows this:

Primary Spending Recap:

We saw a total of $43.7M spent by a total of 12 different advertisers.

Pro-Moreno advertisers spent a total of $13.4M.

Pro-Dolan advertisers (including Buckeye Leadership Fund) spent $17.3M.

Pro-LaRose advertisers spent $5.2M.

Lastly, the pro-Brown IE, spent $2M boosting Moreno with an attack ad in the final week.

Broadcast TV saw the bulk of the spending with a total of $33.8M, about 77% of the total spend. Cable TV saw $7.5M, about 17%. Rounding out the top 3 was Addressable Statewide Satellite TV with $352K, about 1%.

The top market for spending was Cleveland at $13.9M, $11.1M was spent in Columbus, $8.2M was spent in Cincinnati, $5.4M was spent in Dayton, $2.5M was spent in Toledo, followed by $1.2M spent in Youngstown rounding out the top 5 markets.

UPDATE 7:45 p.m. ET:

With 2 percent reporting now, Moreno has already cut Dolan’s lead down to just 41 percent to 37 percent. This could be a blowout.

UPDATE 7:38 p.m. ET:

Things just look fantastic for Moreno right now:


With just 1 percent reporting according to the New York Times, as expected, Dolan has an early lead but it looks like this will crumble soon.

UPDATE 7:35 p.m. ET:

Moreno leads Dolan by 10 in the exit polls:


We’re still awaiting results, but this looks fantastic for Moreno.

UPDATE 7:30 p.m. ET:

The polls have now closed in Ohio. Results are expected imminently.

UPDATE 7:15 p.m. ET:

While it’s essentially irrelevant because Trump already is the presumptive GOP nominee for president, the results streaming in now from Florida look very strong for him. He’s higher than 70 percent and looks like he could be on par for around 90 percent. While Nikki Haley dropped out two weeks ago, and she was the last GOP candidate standing against Trump for more than a month before that, she and several others who dropped out earlier do still appear on the ballot in the Sunshine State so Trump’s dominant performance is impressive.

UPDATE 7:12 p.m. ET:

The Cincinnati area may decide the election in Ohio and could be an early indicator of it’ll be close or a Moreno blowout:



UPDATE 7:10 p.m. ET:

An emerging narrative in Ohio is that there are definitely some Democrats who crossed over to vote in the GOP primary:


Who they voted for, why, and more remains to be seen.

Broader exit polls are expected at 7:30 p.m. ET when the polls close.

UPDATE 7:07 p.m. ET:

The early vote numbers in Ohio–both in person and mail–amount to around 230,000 votes. Dolan will do well with these numbers, but Moreno is expected to clean up on election day totals. So, it may begin the night with a pro-establishment mirage of sorts where Dolan looks strong to start but then fades throughout the night. Margins are key in races like this and the question is whether Moreno can run up the score in key areas.


UPDATE 7:04 p.m. ET:

Polls have closed in most of Florida and will close in Ohio in under half an hour.

While we await results in Ohio, exit polls seem to suggest a very pro-Trump electorate:

"Donald Trump Says $454M Bond Could Force Real Estate Fire Sale: ‘ELECTION INTERFERENCE’
",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/03/19/donald-trump-says-454m-bond-could-force-real-estate-fire-sale-election-interference/,"Former President Donald Trump said Tuesday that the $454 million bond required to appeal the civil fraud judgment against him could force a fire sale of his real estate.

New York Attorney General Letitia James’ prosecution of Trump essentially tries to bankrupt the president. Trump must post a liquid (cash, securities) bond covering the full amount of the judgment to pause enforcement of the judgment, but 30 surety companies told Trump they would not accept real estate assets as collateral, Trump’s lawyers said Monday. The enforcement will begin on March 25.

If Trump can not post the $454 million bond, James could seek to freeze some of his bank accounts and properties.

Trump might have to sell his real estate at a “Fire Sale prices” to obtain the cash to appeal the ruling, he said Tuesday on Truth Social:

Judge Engoron actually wants me to put up Hundreds of Millions of Dollars for the Right to Appeal his ridiculous decision. In other words, he is trying to take my Appellate Rights away from me when I have already won at the Appellate Division, but he refuses to accept their already made decision.

“Nobody has ever heard of anything like this before. I would be forced to mortgage or sell Great Assets, perhaps at Fire Sale prices, and if and when I win the Appeal, they would be gone,” Trump added. “Does that make sense? WITCH HUNT. ELECTION INTERFERENCE.”

Constitutional scholar Jonathan Turley believes the financial predicament is a form of “mob justice” that could find its way to the Supreme Court:

His position is in order to get any other judge to look at what I’ve done to you, you’ve got to come up with basically a half a billion dollars just to appeal. It’s like a judge saying, “I’m going to take your house away, but you can appeal my decision. You just have to sell your house in order to do it.” …[M]any people look at this as a type of almost mob justice.

And this could end up going beyond the New York system. They [Trump’s team] could appeal this all the way to the Supreme Court. On occasion, the Supreme Court has intervened in state actions, for example, on punitive damages, and so that points damages can become so high they deny someone due process of law. This is falling into that extreme category, in my view. I find it appalling.

Turley concluded, “It shocks the conscience that you have to pony up this type of money just to get someone to look at what you believe, and I believe, is an excessive ruling by this judge.”",3/19/2024,WENDELL HUSEBØ,BREITBART,"[{""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""fire sale""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""National Rifle Association""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Supreme Court""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""New York""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Truth Social""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Appellate Division""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""surety companies""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Kathy Willens""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""press conference""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""WITCH HUNT""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Letitia James""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Fire Sale""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Jonathan Turley""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Judge Engoron""}]",0.44

"US primary elections: Biden and Trump notch wins in five states
",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/19/us-elections-2024-primaries-biden-trump,"Donald Trump and Joe Biden swept up more delegates in Tuesday’s primary elections as they set their sights on a rematch in November.

Trump and Biden picked up wins in Arizona, Illinois, Kansas and Ohio. Trump also won the Republican primary in Florida, where the Democrats are not holding a primary.

In Ohio, Illinois and Florida, the former South Carolina governor and presidential candidate Nikki Haley still captured a sizable fraction of the Republican vote, despite no longer being in the race.

The president and former president had already won enough delegates to capture their parties’ presidential nominations, and most of their challengers have dropped out. Trump’s last Republican challenger, his former UN ambassador Nikki Haley, ended her presidential campaign after Super Tuesday. Biden’s long-shot challenger, the Democratic congressman Dean Phillips, dropped out as well.

With the presidential nominating contests clinched, the candidates were focusing on campaigning in swing states they will need to win the general election in November.

In recent days, Biden visited Arizona and Nevada, where he is looking to shore up the support of young and Latino voters who could be key to his re-election. Biden is touting economic policies and attacking Trump on immigration and abortion as he seeks to win over wavering voters and waning enthusiasm among groups that backed him in 2020.

Democrats seeking to register frustration with Biden over his handling of the war in Gaza are urging supporters to vote for the self-help guru Marianne Williamson in Arizona – as she, unlike Biden, has called for a permanent ceasefire. Pro-Palestinian protesters in Ohio, meanwhile, are urging supporters to “Leave It Blank”.

Trump, meanwhile, has continued to court controversy on the campaign trail amid ongoing legal troubles. He claimed that Jewish people voting for Democrats “hate their religion” and Israel, in an interview on Monday – drawing outrage. As he criss-crosses the country to rally supports and raise funds, he has also increasingly made the January 6 attack on the Capitol a cornerstone of his campaign, saluting rioters as heroes.

In Illinois, Ohio, Illinois and California, a few key down-ballot races have been hotly contested.

Ohio
In Ohio, Bernie Moreno, whom Trump endorsed, has won the Republican US Senate primary, and will face the Democratic incumbent, Sherrod Brown, in November, the AP projects. Moreno, a wealthy former car dealer who has never held an elected office, was leading in polls ahead of election day, edging out the state senator Matt Dolan and the secretary of state, Frank LaRose.

Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians baseball team, had the backing of establishment Republicans, including the governor, Mike DeWine.
Moreno’s candidacy had been weighed down by questions about his qualifications and lack of experience. Having espoused virulently anti-LGBTQ+ policies, he was also the subject of an Associated Press report that found his work email was used to create an account on an adult website seeking “men for 1-on-1 sex” in 2008. Moreno had denied the report.

Republicans have targeted Brown’s seat as one they could flip in November – he is Ohio’s only statewide elected Democrat in a state that has moved dramatically to the right in recent years.

Illinois
In Illinois, the 82-year-old Democratic incumbent congressman Danny Davis will defend his seat in November after fighting off a progressive challenge, the AP projects. Davis was backed by the state’s governor, JB Pritzker, and the Chicago mayor, Brandon Johnson, but faced a tough challenge from the community organizer and gun-control advocate Kina Collins, a community organizer and gun control advocate.

"Trump signals support for a national 15-week abortion ban
",https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-signals-support-15-week-abortion-ban-rcna144213,"Former President Donald Trump is suggesting he would be open to supporting a national ban on abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is endangered.

In a radio interview Tuesday with Sid Rosenberg on WABC, Trump weighed in on what he thinks would be an appropriate limit on the procedure after he touted the Supreme Court’s overturning in 2022 of the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling — which came after he appointed three conservative justices to the court.

“The number of weeks now, people are agreeing on 15, and I’m thinking in terms of that, and it’ll come out to something that’s very reasonable,” he said. “But people are really — even hard-liners are agreeing — seems to be 15 weeks, seems to be a number that people are agreeing at.”

Trump said that he would make an announcement on what specific limit on abortion he would support “at the appropriate time” before going on to say that it should be left to the states to decide.

“The issue of abortion, we brought it back to the states,” Trump said, referring to the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade. “And everybody agrees, you’ve heard this for years, all the legal scholars on both sides agree, it’s a state issue. It shouldn’t be a federal issue, it’s a state issue.”

The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment.

In response to Trump’s remarks, the Biden campaign shared a statement from Amanda Zurawski, a woman who is suing Texas over its abortion ban. Zurawski said she nearly died in 2022 after doctors initially declined to perform an abortion as she suffered severe complications 18 weeks into her pregnancy. Doctors eventually gave her an abortion when her health deteriorated.

“My family has been forever altered by the nightmare that Donald Trump created by overturning Roe. I nearly died because my doctor could not give me the care I needed — and my ability to have children in the future has been forever compromised by the damage that was caused,” she said.

Donald Trump asks to pause Jan. 6 lawsuits as his criminal case lingers
The former president's remarks provide the clearest indication yet of what limits to abortion rights he would potentially support.

The New York Times reported last month that Trump privately told his advisers that he favors a ban after 16 weeks of pregnancy, which would include exceptions in cases of rape and incest and if a woman’s life is in danger.

A source familiar with conversations told NBC News at the time that Trump had raised the possibility of supporting a 16-week abortion ban in discussions with his advisers. However, a separate source stressed that the former president did not take a stance on a federal abortion ban.

The Trump campaign had pushed back on the reporting, calling it “fake news.”

“As President Trump has stated, he would sit down with both sides and negotiate a deal that everyone will be happy with,” Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement last month. “Joe Biden and virtually every Democrat in Congress is on the record supporting radical on-demand abortion.”",3/20/2024,Summer Concepcion and Jake Traylor,NBC News,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Supreme Court""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Amanda Zurawski""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""states""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Biden campaign""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Roe""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""NBC News""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""WABC""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Roe v.

"Biden and Obama look to capitalize on Trump’s latest threats to repeal Obamacare
",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/20/politics/barack-obama-joe-biden-donald-trump-obamacare/index.html,"President Joe Biden and former President Barack Obama will team up to rally supporters around the Affordable Care Act’s 14th anniversary this weekend as Democrats make their latest move to capitalize on former President Donald Trump’s threats to repeal Obamacare.

Biden and Obama, along with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, will hold a national organizing call on Saturday to mobilize supporters “around protecting the ACA from Trump’s attacks,” a campaign official said. The call is part of a weekend of action to rally voters around the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature accomplishment, which the former president signed into law on March 23, 2010.

It comes as the campaign has been eager to make health care a key issue in the 2024 campaign after Trump resurrected talk of repealing Obamacare if he secures a second term in the White House.

Although the Affordable Care Act became law without Republican support, and the GOP spent much of the remainder of Obama’s time in office trying to repeal it, the law has surged in popularity since Trump took office in 2017. Biden campaign officials believe preserving the law is a potent political issue, as Obamacare sign-ups for 2024 coverage hit a record 21.3 million.

Trump vowed to repeal the law when he became president but failed to do so – in large part because neither he nor congressional Republicans had a solid replacement health care plan. The last major repeal measure failed in Congress in the first year of Trump’s term, when the late Sen. John McCain joined Democrats and a few other Republicans in ending the effort.

That was around the last time the law was viewed unfavorably by more Americans than favorably. Today, a near record 59% of Americans view the Affordable Care Act favorably, according to KFF, a nonpartisan research group.

More than 40 million Americans now have health care coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act, up from just under 27 million in 2017, according to the Department of Health and Human Services.

Biden and advocates for the landmark health reform law are also highlighting its other key benefits, including protecting those with pre-existing conditions from being charged more by insurers, offering free preventive care, including cancer screenings, cholesterol tests and annual checkups, providing increased access to mental health and substance abuse treatment through Medicaid and allowing children to stay on their parents’ health insurance until age 26.

Trump once again talks of repeal
The Affordable Care Act would be far harder to repeal today since it is more embedded in the nation’s health care system than it was in 2017.

Nevertheless, Trump last year began renewing his vows to repeal the act in his latest run for the White House – to the surprise and dismay of some of his own advisers.

“We’re gonna fight for much better health care than Obamacare,” Trump said in a speech in Newton, Iowa earlier this year. “Obamacare is a catastrophe. Nobody talks about it. You know, without John McCain, we would have had it done.”

Biden’s campaign plans to hold more than 20 in-person events in battleground states with local elected officials and individuals benefiting from the health care law starting on Thursday. There will also be an advertising and social media push around the anniversary.

The call marks the latest collaboration between Biden and his former boss in the 2024 campaign. They released a video last year vowing to protect and expand Obamacare amid threats from Trump, and Obama has helped with some of the campaign’s fundraising appeals.

Biden and Obama also are set to appear together in-person next Thursday for a New York City fundraiser featuring the two presidents and former President Bill Clinton.",3/20/2024,"Arlette Saenz, Michael Williams and Tami Luhby,",CNN,"[{""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""national organizing call""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""House""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""GOP""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Nancy Pelosi""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""KFF""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Affordable Care Act""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""John McCain""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Barack Obama""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""White House""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Congress""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024 campaign""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Department of Health and Human Services""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}]",0.62
"Supreme Court escalates high-stakes border drama between Biden, Texas and Trump
",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/20/politics/supreme-court-texas-biden-trump/index.html,"For a few fleeting hours Tuesday, Texas was able to enforce a hardline immigration law blasted by critics as an affront to human rights – thanks to a huge assist from the conservative majority on the US Supreme Court.

The intervention by the nation’s top bench triggered a day of twisting legal drama that only exacerbated the chaos over the nation’s overwhelmed immigration system, reinforced the politicization of the court and stoked fresh controversy over an issue that threatens President Joe Biden’s reelection.

The measure allows Texas to arrest and even deport people it suspects of crossing the border illegally – a flagrant challenge to the federal government’s authority on such issues.

It came into force, briefly, after the Supreme Court said the law could proceed while an appeals process plays out in lower courts. But late Tuesday evening, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals put the law on hold again – muting celebrations in the Lone Star State. The panel of judges that issued the late-night ruling is already due to hear arguments Wednesday morning over the statute, known as SB 4.

The fresh uncertainty about the law will only supercharge a fierce debate over immigration fueled by Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump as the general election heats up. And even though it was later overtaken, the Supreme Court’s move allowed Republicans to showcase their tough immigration policies and claim that Biden has lost control of the border.

The legal back-and-forth will also set off more feuding between Washington and the ultra-conservative government of Texas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott over policy and enforcement.

The Supreme Court stepped into the controversy weeks after Republicans in Congress killed off a conservative compromise that stiffened border and asylum policy and included huge concessions from Biden as he seeks to ease his exposure on the issue at the risk of alienating progressives. Some top Republicans blamed Trump for working to scupper the measure to deprive Biden of an important win in during the election year.

A federal judge in Austin had blocked the state government from implementing the Texas law. But the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals granted a temporary stay of the lower court’s decision, which prompted a pair of emergency appeals from the Biden administration and others. The Supreme Court said Tuesday the law can go into force while the 5th Circuit appeals process plays out.

In a brief order Tuesday night, a three-judge panel at the 5th Circuit voted 2-1 to wipe away a previous ruling from a different panel that had temporarily put the law into effect. So a day of shifting legal fortunes ended with the Texas law still not implemented.

Republicans in Texas say that the law’s enforcement mechanisms are well within their constitutional rights as a state. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, for example, hailed the Supreme Court move on X as “a huge win.” But if the law does go back into effect, much will depend on how Texas and its law enforcement authorities in more conservative jurisdictions in the state implement the law and if they use its full extent – to arrest and deport suspected undocumented migrants.

Immigrant advocacy groups have warned that the law could lead to racial profiling and civil rights violations and arrests that could terrorize undocumented migrants far from border areas. “Today is March 19, a day that, I believe, will be known in infamy as a ‘show me your papers day,’” said LULAC (League of United Latin American Citizens) national president Domingo Garcia. Abbott, however, has argued that police officers in Texas know that racial profiling is wrong.

A cascade of political consequences
Supreme Court justices are supposed to make decisions only with respect to the law, not potential political consequences. In a concurrence to the decision, conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett stressed that it should not be up to the court to intervene when lower courts like the 5th Circuit issue a temporary stay of a decision.

But the Supreme Court’s intervention was its latest foray into fraught political territory. It will play into criticisms among Democrats that the court is boosting conservative interests that helped build its majority and that it is in tacit alliance with right-wing legislators, governors and candidates. In the most controversial recent move, the court agreed to hear Trump’s expansive claim of presidential immunity, delaying his federal election interference trial and raising the prospect the former president could avoid accountability for trying to overturn the 2020 election before he faces voters again in 2024.

Similar arguments played out when the Supreme Court ditched decades of precedent and overturned the nationwide constitutional right to an abortion in 2022 – a decision that led to the current patchwork of state restrictions and policies that has caused chaos in the health care system. The overturning of Roe v. Wade has also caused subsequent legal reverberations – for instance the pausing of some IVF fertility treatments in Alabama after the state’s Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos are children.

Immigration reform advocates fear that a similar web of contradicting state laws and tensions between federal and state power could be in store on immigration if the Texas law is ultimately allowed to go into effect for the long term.

White House warns of chaos
The White House issued a scathing response to the Supreme Court’s decision, arguing it would make Texas less safe, burden law enforcement and “sow chaos and confusion at our southern border.” Press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre warned that SB 4 was “another example of Republican officials politicizing the border while blocking real solutions.”

Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut predicted on CNN Tuesday that the Supreme Court decision would lead to “a mess.” He told Wolf Blitzer: “You can’t have two immigration enforcement systems – one run by the federal government and one run by the state government.” And Texas Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro warned in a statement that the “Supreme Court has opted to allow for a trial run of a constitutional crisis.”

Beyond the politics, the Texas law comes with important constitutional and even international implications. It grants local and state law enforcement the power to arrest migrants and state judges the ability to issue orders to remove them to Mexico. The Department of Justice sued the state, arguing the federal government has exclusive authority to enforce immigration law. The prospect of Texas deporting migrants to Mexico also raises the possibility of an individual state taking actions that could have huge implications for relations between the United States and another sovereign power. The conduct of foreign affairs is reserved for the federal government in the constitution.

The dispute over the Texas law follows several previous occasions when conservative-run states have sought to take actions to implement their own hardline immigration policies, causing a clash with the federal government. Last year, for instance, Florida – at a time when GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis was running for president – organized flights of undocumented migrants from Texas to liberal jurisdictions. If Texas eventually succeeds in implementing its own new law challenging federal government power to administer immigration, it would not be a surprise if other states try to follow suit.

John Sandweg, who served as acting Immigration and Customs Enforcement director in the Obama administration, told CNN he was stunned by the Supreme Court decision that he said flew in the face of long-standing precedent. He argued that when other states had tried to enforce their own border enforcement schemes, “the court has shut them down.”

The president is under huge pressure to address a glaring weakness over immigration. A CNN poll last released month showed just 30% of Americans approved of his performance on the issue and 79% of voters – including majorities across party lines – said that the situation on the border represents a crisis. While conservative media and politicians have spent years trolling the president with misleading coverage about migrant caravan invasions and open borders, the high interception of border crossers also deeply worries many non-conservative voters.

As he did when congressional Republicans thwarted the border bill recently, Biden is expected to argue that their hardline policies are making things worse. Even before Tuesday’s ruling, the president significantly stepped up his own rhetoric on immigration, blasting his predecessor and rival for his tone over the weekend.

“He separated kids and parents at the border, and encaged children. Planning mass deportations of literally several million people who are here in the country. Several million people. And he wants to end birthright citizenship,” Biden said on Univision Radio on Tuesday.

“I mean, this guy despises Latinos,” the president said, as he headed off on a tour of swing states Arizona and Nevada, where the immigration issue is paramount and where he needs to shore up his defenses against Trump.",3/20/2024,Stephen Collinson,CNN,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Texas""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Lone Star State""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""reelection""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""general election""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Supreme Court""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Greg Abbott""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Austin""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""federal government""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Washington""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Congress""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""US Supreme Court""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""5th US Circuit Court""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""5th Circuit Court of Appeals""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""state government""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}]",0.48
"Key takeaways from Tuesday's primaries: Warning signs for Trump, Biden; Moreno wins Ohio GOP Senate primary
",https://www.yahoo.com/news/key-takeaways-from-tuesdays-primaries-warning-signs-for-trump-biden-moreno-wins-ohio-gop-senate-primary-005432301.html,"As this year’s presumptive Democratic and Republican presidential nominees, President Biden and former President Donald Trump swept Tuesday’s uncontested primaries in Florida, Ohio, Arizona, Illinois and Kansas, adding hundreds of delegates to their respective tallies and continuing their unimpeded march to the summer conventions, where they will formally accept their parties’ nominations.

But this week’s contests weren’t entirely devoid of drama, especially with a pivotal U.S. Senate primary in Ohio. Here are some key takeaways from the latest round.

Resistance remains
It’s no secret that significant numbers of Democrats and Republicans don’t want to nominate Biden and Trump (again).

Even now, 21% of potential GOP primary voters prefer “someone else” over Trump, according to a new Yahoo News/YouGov poll — while a full 35% of their Democratic-leaning counterparts prefer someone else over Biden.

But will that resistance keep materializing at the ballot box? Or will it subside now that the contested phase of the 2024 primary season is petering out?

Tuesday offered some clues. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley together drew just under 20% of the vote, despite having dropped out of the race.

In 2020, Trump won nearly 94% of the Florida primary vote as an incumbent president facing two long-shot opponents. This year, he captured about 81% of the vote.

The results were similar in other states. Haley won about 20% of the vote in Arizona, 16% in Kansas and 14% in Ohio and Illinois. In Kansas, an option for “None of the Names Shown” took another 5% of the vote.

The only way to interpret these continued votes for DeSantis, Haley and other options is as a protest against Trump.

This opposition could extend to the general election. In Ohio on Tuesday, half of Haley’s supporters said they would back Biden over Trump in November, according to preliminary exit polls.

Similarly, progressives are still turning out on the Democratic side to protest Biden’s Gaza policy. So far, an average of 10% of 2024 Democratic primary participants have voted for “uncommitted” in states where that’s been an option, according to the New York Times — while about 12% have voted for a named candidate other than Biden in places where “uncommitted” hasn’t appeared on the ballot.

That’s higher than the average “protest” vote (about 7%) across uncontested primaries in 2004, 2012 and 2020.

Tuesday’s protest votes didn’t quite match earlier highs in Michigan, Minnesota and Hawaii. But 10% voted “None of the Names Shown” in otherwise moderate Kansas. Dean Phillips, a little-known congressman from Minnesota who ended his campaign after Super Tuesday, pulled 13% of the vote in Ohio.

Of course, such numbers are far too small to derail the Biden or Trump candidacies. But with “double haters” — voters who dislike both nominees but are still engaged enough to vote — set to decide the election, Tuesday’s results signal just how much work both men have left to do, especially in key battleground states.

The race to replace McCarthy

In California, Republican state Legislator Vince Fong advanced to a May election to decide who will complete the remainder of former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy’s term, which runs through January.

According to the Associated Press, it was not yet clear who will emerge from a crowded field to take on Fong in the May 21 special election in the solidly conservative district. Republicans are expected to easily hold the seat.

Fong, a onetime McCarthy aide, was endorsed by the former speaker — and by Trump.

Key Senate race is set
While presidential primary numbers are always interesting, hard-core politicos were paying more attention Tuesday to the results of Ohio’s GOP Senate primary, in which state Sen. Matt Dolan, Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and businessman Bernie Moreno competed for a chance to take on longtime Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown in November.

In the end, Moreno came out on top. The Associated Press called the contest at 8:35 p.m.


The race was critical for two reasons.

First, Brown is an old-school progressive populist who has found a way to keep winning in increasingly red Ohio by emphasizing the “dignity of work” — but he will still be one of the Senate’s most vulnerable Democrats this fall, and Republicans may only need to net a single seat to recapture control of the chamber. That put a lot of weight on their choice of nominee.

Second, the primary battle between Moreno and Dolan turned into a proxy war between the GOP’s MAGA and establishment factions over the future of the party itself. Dolan — who has consistently said that Trump lost the 2020 election and bears blame for Jan. 6 — won the backing of Gov. Mike DeWine and former Sen. Rob Portman; Moreno, a former car dealer, attracted the support of Trump and Sen. J.D. Vance.

At a rally over the weekend, Trump praised Moreno as an “America first champion” who is “going to be a warrior in Washington,” while Moreno mocked his opponent as “Mitt Dolan” (in reference to now-Utah senator and frequent Trump critic Mitt Romney, the GOP’s establishment-friendly 2012 nominee).

On Tuesday, Moreno’s MAGA message worked — even with a third candidate, LaRose, splitting the antiestablishment vote. It’s another sign that the GOP base has yet to learn the lessons of its 2018, 2020 and 2022 losses — and that it’s gravitating toward candidates who aim to excite Trump loyalists rather than persuade swing voters.

Nearly every pre-primary poll showed Brown leading Moreno by a much larger margin than Dolan.

Gauging the Latino vote
One of the biggest political stories of the last few years has been the rightward drift among Latino voters, who previously voted Democratic by overwhelming margins and whom Democrats have long taken for granted as part of their “emerging coalition.”

In 2012, Barack Obama beat Romney by 40 percentage points among Latino voters nationally, according to Catalist, a political research firm. In 2016, Hillary Clinton did even better, winning the Latino vote by 42 points.

But in 2020, Biden’s margin among Latinos shrank to 26 points — a shift driven at least in part by working-class Latinos and because more Latino men voted Republican than in the past.

According to the New York Times, primary results earlier this month in Texas added “more evidence of this shift: In the heavily Latino counties of the lower Rio Grande Valley, Mr. Biden averaged less than 65 percent of the vote in the Democratic primary earlier this month.

"Trump signals support for 15-week national abortion ban
",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-says-leaning-toward-15-132056870.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) -Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he was leaning toward a 15-week national ban on abortion but supports exceptions for rape, incest and saving the life of the mother because ""you have to win elections.""

Abortion promises to be a galvanizing issue for some voters in the 2024 presidential election in which Trump will try to unseat Democratic President Joe Biden.

A call for a 15-week national ban is likely to displease both sides of the abortion debate, with conservative groups unhappy with what they view as an overly permissive time limit and abortion-rights activists opposing the idea of any kind of national ban.

The former Republican president, whose three conservative appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court secured the majority needed to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, has not been specific on whether he would sign a national ban into law.

In a call-in radio interview on Tuesday, he came close.

""The number of weeks now, people are agreeing on 15. And I'm thinking in terms of that. And it’ll come out to something that’s very reasonable. But people are really, even hard-liners are agreeing, seems to be, 15 weeks seems to be a number that people are agreeing at,"" Trump said on the ""Sid & Friends in the Morning"" show on WABC.

Trump said he backed exceptions to a ban on abortion when it involved rape, incest or saving the life of the mother, which he said the vast majority of Republicans support.

Trump said he tells Republicans who push a harder line: ""Here's the problem, you have to win elections. And otherwise, you'd be right back where you started.""

The Biden campaign has taken aim at Republican curbs on reproductive rights in states after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe ruling that recognized a woman's constitutional right to abortion. Voter backlash was widely credited with limiting Republican gains in the congressional elections that followed.

The Supreme Court's action allowed the matter to be decided on a state-by-state basis, and in response, Republicans have issued restrictive abortion laws in nearly two dozen states.

The New York Times reported last month that Trump has privately expressed support for a 16-week ban.

While Trump has argued for months that the six-week ban some states have enacted is overly harsh and politically toxic, he was reluctant to clarify his position regarding a national ban during his push for the Republican nomination when some rivals called for a more restrictive approach.

Abortion-rights groups have been warning that Republicans would attempt to institute a national ban if they won the White House after Roe v. Wade fell - and Trump's support for one likely will spur their advocacy and fundraising.

“Time and again, Donald Trump has shown us who he is — and we believe him. These latest comments reaffirm what we’ve long known: if given the chance, he will enact a national ban on abortion,"" said Mini Timmaraju, president of Reproductive Freedom for All, the group formerly known as NARAL.

Democrats see the issue as a potential difference-maker in the coming presidential and congressional elections in November.

""Women are being hurt today by Trump and his allies' actions,"" the Biden campaign said in a statement on Wednesday in response to Trump's interview.

The anti-abortion group Students for Life issued a statement urging Trump not to support such a federal ban, terming it a ""bridge to nowhere"" and arguing it would allow too many abortions to still take place.",3/20/2024,Doina Chiacu and James Oliphant,yahoo,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""elections""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""states""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""WABC""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Reuters""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Supreme Court""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""conservative groups""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""congressional elections""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""U.S. Supreme Court""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024 presidential election""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""WASHINGTON""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}]",0.55

Ultimately, Moreno − and by extension, Trump − won the three-way primary. DeWine called Moreno's primary performance a ""very impressive victory"" and said Trump's endorsement is ""pretty essential"" in today's GOP primary. Trump's endorsement also propelled GOP Sen. J.D. Vance to victory in 2022.

"Explainer-How a third-party candidate could put Trump in the White House
",https://www.yahoo.com/news/explainer-third-party-candidate-could-150259877.html,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democrats and Republicans dominate the U.S. two-party political system, but independent candidates like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other third-party challengers could have a major impact in this year's presidential election.

Reuters spoke to a dozen strategists who are gaming out how a third-party candidate could land in the unusual U.S. electoral college system.

Early scenarios show a third-party candidate is likely to take more votes from President Joe Biden, a Democrat, than Republican former President Donald Trump. Even narrow margins could make a difference in a handful of battleground states that are decided by a thin sliver of votes and could go Democrat or Republican.

Those states are crucial in amassing the 270 electoral college votes needed for victory.

NARROW MARGINS AND RFK Jr.

November's most important battleground states are Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina. In the 2020 election, Biden won all these states except North Carolina; they were all decided by less than 3% of the vote.

Kennedy is running on a platform of limiting U.S. intervention in foreign conflicts, cheaper housing and reining in corporate power, and has positioned himself as an outsider alternative to Biden and Trump. He has the support of 15% of registered voters, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll shows.

Even a fraction of that support could be meaningful in the battleground states, which allocate all their electoral votes to the candidate who gets the most individual votes. Strategists are zeroing in on Pennsylvania, which has 19 electoral votes, and where Biden won with just 50% of overall votes in 2020 versus Trump's 48.8%.

If Biden loses Pennsylvania, he'd need a repeat win of Georgia, Arizona, Wisconsin and Michigan to get to 270. If he loses Georgia, too, then Trump wins the White House.

It could be an echo of the 2000 election, when third-party candidate Ralph Nader ran as an alternative to Democrat Al Gore and Republican George W. Bush, some strategists say. Nader was polling at about 5%, recalls Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver.

""In the end, he only pulled about 3% of the vote in Florida. But that proved to be enough,"" Masket said. Bush and Gore's vote margin in Florida was so narrow that the dispute went to the Supreme Court, which ultimately decided the election for Bush.

TRUMP'S HARD FLOOR

Both Biden and Trump have low overall approval ratings - at or below 40% in many polls - but a third party is not expected to damage Trump as much because his voter base is loyal, strategists say.

That means he is unlikely to lose core voters if any third party is presented, although it is harder for him to gain supporters.

""He probably can't get above, let's say 47% of the vote,"" estimates Matt Bennett, executive vice president for public affairs at Third Way, a center-left think tank working with Democrats to thwart third-party bids. ""But he also isn't going to drop very much.""

Lucas Holtz, a political analyst for Third Way, estimates the Trump's hard floor - or minimum share of the vote thanks to his committed supporters - is 35.5%.

Biden, on the other hand, could gain voters but does not enjoy the same loyal base, strategists say, making him the most vulnerable to a third-party effort.

""Uncommitted"" protest votes in Michigan's primary last month garnered 14% of the state's Democrat voters who are upset over Biden backing Israel's military campaign against Hamas in Gaza, for example.

NO ONE GETS 270 VOTES

Another question is whether a third-party candidate could siphon off enough of the 538 electoral votes at stake to stop Biden or Trump from reaching the 270-vote threshold.

It's very unlikely but not impossible, strategists say. Theodore Roosevelt's third-party Progressives got 88 electoral votes in 1912, while George Wallace's pro-segregation party got 46 in 1968. George W. Bush won in 2000 by just five electoral college votes.

Strategists are gaming out two potential ""contingent election"" scenarios in which no one secures 270 electoral votes.

In those scenarios, a third-party candidate would beat Biden to win Wisconsin, with its 10 electoral votes, or Michigan, with its 15 electoral votes, but Trump would still win Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and Nevada.

That would result in neither candidate reaching 270 votes, at which point the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives would elect a president by allocating one vote to each of the U.S.'s 50 states.

A simple majority, 26 state votes, would decide the presidency, a situation that would elect Trump. Currently, Republicans control 26 state delegations, while Democrats control 22.

The Senate, controlled by Democrats, would elect a vice president from the two vice presidential candidates with the most electoral votes. In that unlikely scenario, the U.S. could wind up with a Republican president and Democratic vice president for the first time in history.

A CLEAN THIRD-PARTY VICTORY?

It is hard for political analysts to envisage a third-party candidate amassing 270 electoral votes on their own because outside of the swing states, either Republicans or Democrats control too much of the overall vote.

Ross Perot, a third-party candidate who got 19% of the national popular vote in 1992, still did not win any state or pick up a single electoral college vote.

"Donald Trump: ‘Safety and Security’ Driving Women, Minority Voters to Me and GOP, Away from ‘Lunatic’ Biden and Democrats
",https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/03/20/exclusive-donald-trump-safety-and-security-driving-women-minority-voters-to-me-and-gop-away-from-lunatic-biden-and-democrats/,"PALM BEACH, Florida — Former President Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president in 2024, told Breitbart News exclusively that the primary drivers of demographic shifts in the electorate where women and minority voters are leaving Democrats to side with him are “safety and security.”

Trump told Breitbart News in a more than 90-minute long exclusive interview last week here at his luxurious seaside resort and club Mar-a-Lago that polls are showing “numbers we’ve never seen” before with women, black, and Hispanic voters.

Asked what is driving the demographic shifts away from Democrats to him and Republicans among these groups, Trump said, “Safety and security, more than anything else.”

Trump said that “lunatic” Democrat President Joe Biden and broader Democrat policies are making women and minority voters less safe.

“They don’t feel safe with this lunatic,” Trump said. “He’s a terrible president. He’s the worst president in history. He’s the most incompetent and most corrupt president we’ve ever had. He’s willing to weaponize the Justice Department to go after his opponent. Nobody ever thought that was ever going to be happening in our country. It happens in a lot of countries in the third world, banana republics. But nobody ever thought they’d see that. But above all, I believe they want security. They don’t want people knocking on their door, saying, ‘We’re taking over your house.’ That’s really where we’re heading. We’re heading to a nation like we’ve never seen before.”

Trump is absolutely right that there are major swings happening in these key demographics away from Biden and Democrats toward him and Republicans. While Biden won women voters by 11 points in 2020 over Trump, New York Times polling shows Trump erasing that advantage entirely and that Trump has pulled even with Biden into a dead-on tie among women voters.


The New York Times/Siena College poll in question, released in March, shows Trump drawing even with Biden among women and making serious gains among black and Hispanic voters.

“The poll offers an array of warning signs for the president about weaknesses within the Democratic coalition, including among women, Black and Latino voters,” the Times’ Shane Goldmacher wrote about the survey.

When it comes to Hispanic voters, look no further than a recent headline in the Economist magazine: “Joe Biden’s Weakness Among Latinos Threatens His Re-election.” In the piece, the magazine reveals that Trump made significant gains in the Hispanic community from 2016 to 2020, and “if current polling is anything to go by, Mr Trump looks set to cut further into Mr Biden’s margins with Latino voters come November.”

With black voters, it might be even worse for Biden and better for Trump on the margins. Al Jazeera, of all places, recently published a major piece questioning why Trump is making big gains here. The story notes that, according to exit polls in 2016, Trump won about eight percent of the black vote, the highest for a Republican in decades. “By the 2020 US presidential election, support for Trump among Black voters had surged to 12 percent,” Al Jazeera’s Dwayne Oxford wrote. “And, while current opinion polls vary, a recent survey from GenForward shows that if the elections were held today, 17 percent of Black voters would vote for Donald Trump while 20 percent said they would vote for someone other than Trump or Biden.”

As Trump told Breitbart News, he believes it’s all about “safety and security.” He also thinks, as he expanded on during his interview with Breitbart News, that a key factor driving these sentiments in these demographics is the record levels of migration that Biden and his Democrat administration are facilitating into the country and the problems that come with millions more people here than otherwise would have been in the country.

“We have, I believe, 15 million more people in here,” Trump told Breitbart News. “Many of them came out of jails, prisons, and many of them came out of mental institutions, and — as I say it in the speeches — insane asylums. You have many terrorists coming into our country. We’re going to pay a big price for this. This is a bomb waiting to explode. We’re going to be paying a big price for this. I say my campaign and my policies are based on common sense. They happen to be conservative policies, but I say to a large extent being conservative is based on common sense. Who would allow a wall not to be built? And they say, ‘No we don’t need a wall; we’ll send little things up in the air.’ To what? To watch people come in? All they do is watch people come in. We’re going to have 15 million people come in here, and probably do about now — it could be 18 to 20 million people by the end of his term. Eighteen to 20 million people. That’s bigger than New York State. That’s bigger than almost every state in the union.”

These record numbers, Trump said, affect everyone’s everyday lives among people who would rather not be bothered by politics — and as such, it is waking them up and turning them his way. What is more, Trump noted many of the people coming from other nations throughout Latin America and the rest of the world through Biden’s open border are bad people.

“These countries are not allowing their best and their finest to come — they want to keep them,” Trump said. “These are not stupid people. They’re very streetwise and smart people, the leaders of those countries. They’re not allowing the people who have been the beacon of working to come. But in addition to that, they’re emptying their prisons and their mental institutions into our country, and terrorists are also coming in. This is a disaster. You say, ‘How could this be possible?’ I think we may win places nobody ever thought of before. I’m going to play in New York, and nobody thought we could do it, but I have friends in New York who are Democrats that hate the Democrats now. They said they’ve ruined our city. They destroyed it. They ruined it by having 500,000 migrants taking over the parks. Kids can’t play little league anymore. It sounds like a very mundane thing that they can’t play little league anymore, they can’t play football anymore — they can’t go for a walk in the park — but it’s a very big thing in terms of life.”",3/20/2024,MATTHEW BOYLE and ALEXANDER MARLOW,BREITBART,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Biden""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""third world""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""PALM BEACH""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2024""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republican""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Florida""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""banana republics""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""New York Times""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Siena College""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Republicans""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Breitbart News""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Justice Department""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Mar-a-Lago""}]",0.38
"Trump lags behind Biden in campaign cash reserves while legal bills mount
",https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/20/trump-biden-fundraising-campaign/,"President Biden’s campaign continues to boast a significant cash advantage over Donald Trump’s, as the former president juggles the burdens of fundraising for his bid to return to office and paying his mounting legal bills seven months before the general election.

Federal Election Commission reports filed on Wednesday did not offer a full picture of the comparative strength of the two campaigns, because several of the groups raising money for each presumptive nominee will not disclose their latest totals with the FEC until April.

But the Biden campaign demonstrated a clear fundraising advantage over Trump in filings Wednesday night, reporting $71 million in cash on hand to Trump’s $33.5 million — more than double his rival’s reserves. Biden’s campaign widened the gap from the end of January, when it led Trump’s campaign $56 million to $30.5 million.

The reports underscore the extent to which Trump’s legal troubles are putting a strain on his campaign. Save America, the political action committee that the Trump campaign has been using to pay the legal bills for the former president and many of his associates, spent more than it raised in February — with the vast majority of its spending going to legal costs.

The Save America PAC reported about $4 million in cash on hand at the end of February. It spent about $7 million over the same period, including $5.6 million paid to lawyers. Since the start of this year, Save America has spent $8.5 million on legal bills, and the Trump campaign has spent $1.8 million on such costs.

Trump has used the charges against him as a rallying cry to galvanize his supporters — accusing Democrats and President Biden of weaponizing the powers of the Justice Department against him. (Biden has said that he has not suggested to the Justice Department what it should or should not do regarding charges.) Trump has structured his fundraising effort to benefit from his claims. Each time a donor contributes a dollar to the campaign through his joint fundraising committee, 10 cents is directed to Save America and 90 cents is allocated to the Trump presidential campaign.

Trump’s campaign brought in nearly $11 million in February and had $33.5 million in cash on hand at the end of the month. Almost all of the money that Trump’s campaign brought in during February came in the form of a transfer from a joint fundraising committee, campaign finance records show. Both Biden and Trump rely on a constellation of committees that together can raise and spend money on behalf of their candidacies.

Though Biden has trailed Trump in many of the early national and battleground state polls, the incumbent’s campaign and allied groups are outpacing Trump’s effort in fundraising and the cash stockpiled for the general election. The disparity is fueled in part by the fact that Biden did not face a contested primary and has been able to raise money in conjunction with the Democratic National Committee, as well as state parties.

The Biden campaign said that it ended February with $155 million in the bank and that it raised money from nearly half a million donors. The team also said it raised $53 million in February across all of the five entities that are fundraising for the president’s effort, including the DNC. It did not release a breakdown of how much each committee had raised, and some of those reports will not be available until April.

With flush coffers, the Biden team launched a $30 million spring advertising campaign in key swing states — including an ad aimed at Latino voters. The campaign has said it will open more than 100 offices this month, and Biden launched a national organizing program to engage Hispanic voters in Arizona this week.

The Trump campaign just recently joined forces with the Republican National Committee, which has faced its own fundraising strains, and began integrating their fundraising teams and other staff to create greater efficiencies. The campaign negotiated the terms of a joint fundraising agreement with the RNC and state parties across the country, which will help accelerate fundraising for the GOP effort.

As Trump continues to dominate the GOP landscape in drawing small donors, the RNC’s fundraising has trailed the DNC’s — though allies of the Trump campaign insist that their fundraising will pick up now that the campaign and the RNC are merging their efforts.

On Wednesday, the RNC reported that it had raised $10.7 million in February and ended the month with $11.3 million in cash on hand. The DNC raised $16.6 million and reported more than double the cash on hand with $26.6 million in the bank at the end of the month.

After Trump clinched the nomination earlier this month, his team began a swift revamp of the RNC’s operations as Ronna McDaniel stepped down as the committee’s chair and Michael Whatley took over.

One of Trump’s top advisers, Chris LaCivita, is overseeing the integration of the two operations and addressing dissatisfaction in some sectors of the party about the RNC’s financial situation. Many higher-level aides to the RNC have resigned or been fired in recent weeks and some lower-level staffers were asked to reapply for their jobs.

Despite the upheaval, Whatley said in a memo to RNC members that he was confident that the merging of the two teams would ultimately result in a strong fundraising effort for the GOP. He argued that the recent joint fundraising agreement negotiated by the RNC and the campaign would ensure the party has “the necessary funds to win up and down the ballot.”

“Our two teams will get President Trump’s vision for America in front of as many people as possible, and we are working on merging our digital assets both from the campaign and RNC,” he wrote. “This merger will greatly expand our capacity and reach.”

Democrats mocked the fundraising disparity between the two parties on Wednesday. “If Donald Trump put up these kinds of numbers on The Apprentice, he’d fire himself,” the Biden campaign’s communications director, Michael Tyler, said in a statement.",3/21/2024,Maeve Reston and Clara Ence Morse,Washington Post,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Biden campaign""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Justice Department""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Save America""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democrats""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""President Biden""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""general election""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Federal Election Commission""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""FEC""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Save America PAC""}]",0.69
"In Texas, Biden targets Senator Ted Cruz, raises millions
",https://www.yahoo.com/news/texas-biden-targets-senator-ted-020114965.html,"DALLAS (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden assailed Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz in his home state on Thursday as part of a fundraising tour that has raised millions for Biden's re-election campaign.

Biden, at a fundraiser at the Dallas home of lawyer Russell Budd, urged donors to support U.S. Representative Colin Allred, the Democratic nominee for the Senate seat held by Cruz.

“The stakes couldn’t be higher across the board. And with your help, we’re going to win up and down the ticket, and that includes here in Texas,” Biden said.

“You've got to elect Colin as your next senator... so Ted Cruz joins another loser, Donald Trump,"" Biden said, referring to his likely Republican opponent in the November presidential election.

Budd announced that the event, the first of two fundraisers for Biden in Texas Thursday evening, raised $2.5 million, adding to the tally collected by Biden this week on a Western swing. Biden's campaign raised more than $53 million in February and reported it has $155 million cash on hand.

Trump's campaign reported Wednesday it had raised $10.9 million in February.

Cruz, who lost the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, has been a frequent Biden critic, particularly on Biden's handling of migration along the Texas border with Mexico.

"Trying to nail Jell-O to a wall': On hot-button issues, Trump avoids straight answers
",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trying-nail-jello-wall-hot-201334591.html,"Less than a year ago, Donald Trump took a victory lap for his role in reversing the landmark Supreme Court case that assured women access to abortion.

“I was able to kill Roe v. Wade,” he gloated in an online post in May 2023. “Without me there would be no 6 weeks, 10 weeks, 15 weeks, or whatever is finally agreed to. Without me the pro Life movement would have just kept losing. Thank you President TRUMP!!!”

After positioning himself as an anti-abortion champion, Trump shifted four months later to talk of bringing national consensus.

“I think both sides are going to like me,” he said in an interview with NBC News.

Then, last month, word leaked he would seek a nationwide ban. His campaign called The New York Times report “fake news.” But Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, an ally to the former president, has now told NBC News that “Trump is warming up to 16 weeks.” On Tuesday, Trump mentioned 15 weeks in an interview.

Trump’s ping-ponging on abortion is just one instance of how the former president hasn’t articulated a decisive stance on a critical political issue — though he has said an abortion proposal is forthcoming. With the general election now coming into sharper focus, Trump’s plan of action remains murky on some of the weightiest subjects that would come before him if he took the reins of executive power.

Even after the presidential primary — where candidates’ plans are typically closely litigated — voters have little visibility on Trump’s specific agenda on abortion, the Israel-Gaza war, Ukraine and Social Security, among other issues.

In some cases, Trump has employed a longtime tactic of seemingly taking every side of an issue, with parties able to read what they want into the statements. In others, he suddenly flip-flops. For instance, in 2020, Trump signed an executive order that would ban TikTok if it didn’t sever its ties with a Chinese owner. It was struck down in court. Last week, as Congress considered a similar bill, Trump reversed himself, opposing a TikTok ban. That move came after Trump met with a billionaire Republican mega-donor tied to the company.

While it’s early, so far it’s working for Trump. He’s held a modest but consistent lead over President Joe Biden in most nationwide and battleground state polls.

Patrick Murray, director of the Polling Institute at Monmouth University, said Trump has long leaned on reaching voters by exploiting grievances and promising a shift in their circumstances.

“Trump’s appeal is based on articulating a sense of fear and change in society and not on providing real solutions to those issues,” Murray said. “It’s one of the reasons why he and his allies put a stop to the bipartisan border security bill, because making moves to solve the problem undermines the core reason for his appeal, which is that there is a reason to fear something out there.”

Trump’s campaign took issue with the contention that Trump hasn’t offered specifics on major issues.

“President Trump has released a plethora of extensive policy plans to fix Joe Biden’s crises, including securing our southern border, returning America to energy dominance, saving the auto industry, and ending the nightmare of homelessness in American cities, just to name a few,” Karoline Leavitt, Trump national spokesperson, said in a statement.

Abortion
With abortion, Trump has to walk the line of appeasing his conservative Christian base while attempting not to alienate moderate swing voters.

“It’s like trying to nail Jell-O to a wall to find what his position is,” said Mike Noble, an independent pollster and CEO of Predictive Insights. Noble said it’s no accident that the former president would attempt in the general election campaign to avoid being pinned down on abortion.

“It’s intentional,” Noble said. “It’s just a bad issue for Republicans.”

Trump has acknowledged as much, noting that Republicans have to learn how to talk about abortion if they don’t want to be punished electorally.

“This issue cost us unnecessarily, but dearly, in the midterms,” he said in September.

Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony, an anti-abortion organization, supported a Trump move toward a 16-week abortion ban, saying in a statement last month that he wants to “lead in finding consensus, and this is around where the nation is.”

But with an abortion ban, Trump must navigate tricky politics, even within his own party. The prospect of the marquee candidate on the ticket pushing a federal abortion ban would clash with battleground Republicans running down-ballot in November who softened their abortion stances by rejecting such policies.

And reproductive rights groups want nothing to do with any ban.

“The question we should be asking isn’t when it’s OK for politicians to interfere in people’s personal medical decisions, it’s if,” Angela Vasquez Giroux, Reproductive Freedom for All vice president of communications and research, said in a statement. “And voters have already resoundingly answered that question with seven different ballot initiatives and dozens of elections since Dobbs was overturned: it’s not for politicians to decide.”

Asked Tuesday if indeed Trump’s federal abortion ban proposal was forthcoming, Leavitt characterized the next step as negotiations that have yet to begin. She touted his appointing three Supreme Court justices who were critical to overturning Roe.

“As President Trump has repeatedly stated, he will sit down with both sides and negotiate a deal that everyone will be happy with,” she said.

Israel-Gaza
In the immediate weeks after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, Trump criticized intelligence failures and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying he “let us down.” Trump, who made Israel central to his foreign policy agenda in his first term, had more recently developed a strained relationship with Netanyahu.

After a backlash over those remarks at a time when Israel had been attacked, he expressed his support for Israel and boasted that he “kept Israel safe” when he was in office. He also vowed he wouldn’t allow Gazan refugees into the U.S. and said he would “cut off every penny of money that we send to the Palestinians and the terrorists on day one.”

But as the war dragged on, Trump for months said little about how he would handle the conflict.

After The New York Times highlighted Trump’s silence, he broadly addressed it.

“You’ve got to finish the problem,” Trump said on Fox News on March 5, but did not offer specifics on what that would entail. Over the weekend, Trump said that if he were elected in November he would tell Netanyahu “you have to finish it up, and do it quickly and get back to the world of peace.” The U.S. has been in prolonged talks with both sides over an extended cease-fire, which has yet to materialize.

Trump has not said how hostage negotiations should be handled or how to relieve the humanitarian crisis involving Gaza’s civilian population. His campaign did not respond to those specific policy questions.

On Tuesday, Trump went further on the issue than he has to date. During an interview on WABC, host Sid Rosenberg noted reports that Biden would not help fund Israel’s efforts if it went into Rafah.

“Trump would be giving Bibi Netanyahu everything he needs,” Rosenberg said. “Is that not fair to assume?”

“100%” Trump responded.

Trump then quickly turned to the subject of the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal and how his pulling out of it would have slashed funds to Iran, which has backed Hamas, and therefore the conflict wouldn’t have happened. Trump has repeatedly touted that policy under his watch, and his campaign Tuesday said if Trump is re-elected, “Iran will go back to being broke.”

Trump has lambasted Biden over his handling of the Israel-Gaza war and largely stood back and watched his Democratic counterpart take hits from intraparty criticism over the issue.

“It’s very surprising that a serious candidate for president would say so little about something this important,” said Trump’s former national security adviser John Bolton, who is now a Trump critic. “He doesn’t know what to say. He has not thought this overall circumstance beginning on Oct. 7 through, and he knows he has to say something, so he responds with platitudes and he’s a foot wide and an inch deep.”

Bolton described Trump’s most recent comments as vague enough that they could mean different things to different interests.

""Democrats are committing political suicide over this, and Trump can say things that allow people to read into it whatever they want,” Bolton said.

On Monday, Trump attacked Jews who voted for Democrats, echoing a trope that American Jews have split loyalties to the U.S. and Israel.

“Any Jewish person that votes for Democrats hates their religion,” Trump said in an interview with Sebastian Gorka, a former Trump administration official, on Gorka’s web show. “They hate everything about Israel, and they should be ashamed of themselves, because Israel will be destroyed.”

Republican strategist Brendan Steinhauser said that, regarding Israel, Republicans are confident in Trump because of his actions in office, including moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.

“What he says and what he tweets, that’s one thing — but if you look at what he did, his administration was actually tougher,” Steinhauser said.

Rep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., said he supported some of Trump’s past policies, like moving the embassy and the Abraham Accords. But the congressman was critical of Trump for staying on the sidelines for the most part since Oct. 7, asking why Trump didn’t push Republicans in Congress to back aid for Israel or take other public actions to buttress Israel’s position.

Trump has provided “no leadership from the outside,” he said.

The Republican Jewish Coalition, however, has fully embraced Trump. In its endorsement this month, the group said it leaned heavily on “historic policy accomplishments, which strengthened the U.S.-Israel relationship.”

Ukraine
President Biden is locked in a protracted battle with Republicans over extending funding to Ukraine in its ongoing war with Russia, long arguing that protecting Ukraine is imperative to protecting democracy and keeping more conflicts from erupting worldwide.

Trump, who has built much of his brand on the “America First” label, has helped lead his party in obstructing that funding.

Like with Israel, Trump offers the unprovable contention that the Ukraine conflict would not have happened were he in office. In stump speeches, he makes the lofty pronouncement that he would peacefully end the war within 24 hours, meeting with Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskyy and striking a deal.

“It’s totally unrealistic to think you could solve it in 24 hours,” Bolton said. “And he’s also said he could get Zelenskyy and Putin in a room together and solve it. And that’s not going to happen either.”

The Trump campaign has not said what Trump would offer to end the war, though he once backed turning over parts of Ukraine to Putin in a peace deal.

Trump on occasion has indicated that Russia is not as much of a threat as Democrats would portray it.

In a campaign video entitled “Preventing World War III,” Trump argues that continuing the Ukraine “proxy battle” only risks global war. The video is part of an ""Agenda 47"" series that the campaign has recorded with what it has pointed to as more detailed policy stances from Trump.

“Our foreign policy establishment keeps trying to pull the world into conflict with a nuclear-armed Russia based on the lie that Russia represents our greatest threat,” Trump said on the video. “But the greatest threat to Western Civilization today is not Russia. It’s probably, more than anything else, ourselves and some of the horrible, U.S.A. hating people that represent us.”

Separately, he raised the possibility that he’d encourage Russia to “do whatever the hell they want” against NATO countries who don’t pay enough for defense.

In mid-February, Trump took a 180-degree turn and claimed he was the one who would protect Ukraine and accused Biden of ceding Ukraine to Putin.

But then, another turn. Earlier this month, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said Trump told him during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago he would “not give a penny” to Ukraine if elected. Trump’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment on that contention.

On Tuesday, Trump in an interview said he would support NATO as long as countries pay their “fair share.”

“President Trump has repeatedly stated that a top priority in his second term will be to quickly negotiate an end to the Russia-Ukraine war,” Leavitt, the Trump campaign spokesperson, said. “Also, President Trump believes European nations should be paying more of the cost of the conflict, as the U.S. has paid significantly more, which is not fair to our taxpayers,” she added.

“He will do what is necessary to restore peace and rebuild American strength and deterrence on the world stage, and he is the only person who can make that happen.”

Murray, the pollster, noted that so far, more than 50% of the electorate is sticking with Trump.

“A significant chunk of his support is coming from people who just feel insecure — they feel that the world is changing too quickly around them,” Murray said. “They want somebody who can articulate who’s to blame for them feeling how they feel, and it doesn’t matter if they have real solutions. And that’s why Trump does not need to really articulate a platform because those people don’t need a platform.”

Social Security
In 2023, Trump voiced stern opposition to trimming Social Security.

“Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security,” Trump said in a video message posted to social media.

But last week, in an interview on CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” Trump had a different message.

“So first of all, there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting,” Trump said. “And in terms of, also, the theft and the bad management of entitlements — tremendous bad management of entitlements — there’s tremendous amounts of things and numbers of things you can do.”

Trump’s campaign said he was talking about cutting waste and then attempted to clear up his remark with a reporter of a conservative publication.

In 2020, however, Trump made a similar comment. When an interviewer asked if entitlement cuts would ever be on his agenda, he responded, “at some point they will be.”

When Trump was president, his administration’s budget proposals included recommended cuts to Social Security.

Experts say Medicare will be insolvent in four years while Social Security is solvent until 2033. Unless revenues are added, benefits will be forcibly cut. Biden’s new budget calls for tax hikes on upper-tiered earners to bridge the gap. Trump hasn’t said how he would address the shortfall, and his campaign did not address that question when asked on Tuesday.

“President Trump delivered on his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare in his first term,” Leavitt said, “and President Trump will continue to strongly protect Social Security and Medicare in his second term.""",3/21/2024,Natasha Korecki and Jake Traylor and Peter Nicholas and Jonathan Allen,yahoo,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""NBC News""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Roe v.

"Biden courts Latino voters and presses housing affordability, manufacturing in Nevada and Arizona
",https://www.yahoo.com/news/biden-courts-latino-voters-presses-230102039.html,"Courting Western states’ voters that are critical to his reelection bid, President Biden completed a two-day swing through Nevada and Arizona on Wednesday with a focus on Latinos, housing affordability, taxes — and his predecessor and 2024 rival, former President Trump.

In a series of official White House events and political gatherings, Biden blasted Trump for cutting taxes for the wealthy, increasing the federal deficit and failing to follow through on plans that could help the nation.

""Remember my predecessor kept talking about 'Infrastructure Week' for four years? Well, he didn’t build a damn thing,"" Biden told supporters at a community center in Las Vegas on Tuesday. ""I proposed and signed the most significant investment in our nation’s infrastructure in generations, and now we’re going to have an 'Infrastructure Decade' — so far, 47,000 new projects modernizing Americans’ roads, bridges, ports, airports, public transit ... $3.4 billion in projects right here in Nevada.""

Winning Arizona and Nevada in November — two states Biden narrowly won in 2020 — is vital to the Democrat’s reelection effort. But averages of polling in both states show the incumbent trailing Trump by more than five points in each, according to Real Clear Politics.

These states also figure prominently in some of the most critical issues in this year’s election, such as border security, abortion rights, election denialism and concerns about the softening of support for the Democratic ticket among Latino voters, a critical part of the coalition Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris need to hold to win reelection.

Biden highlighted policy successes that he said have boosted both state's economies, and on Wednesday announced that Intel was being awarded up to $8.5 billion in grants and $11 billion in loans to boost the manufacture of semiconductor chips in Chandler, Ariz., and in other states across the nation — an investment expected to create tens of thousands of jobs.

""Not a damn thing America can't do if we set our mind to it,"" Biden told cheering supporters at a construction site in Chandler. ""It's gonna put us on track to manufacture 20% of the world's leading-edge chips by the end of the decade. And right here in the United States.""

After Biden’s state of the union address earlier this month, Harris immediately traveled to Phoenix and Las Vegas to promote their message — a reflection of Democrats’ need to strengthen their relationship with Latinos that Democratic leaders in these states acknowledge.

“We have not been talking to folks about the issues that President Biden has been delivering on and that's what we are determined to do,” Arizona Democratic Party Chairwoman Yolanda Bejarano told reporters after Biden spoke at a campaign event in Phoenix on Tuesday.

Among the Biden administration’s accomplishments that need to be highlighted include job creation, capping insulin prices and protecting entitlements, Bejarano said. She added that while Trump may be entertaining, Arizona will “be a battle” in November and Democrats must highlight what will happen if he is elected to another term.

“People like [to] laugh at his rallies, you know, it's like they're going to a circus. They're listening to him just joke about things — very, very serious things,” she said. “We just need to be very, very focused and, you know, make sure that Latinos understand exactly who Donald Trump is and what a danger he presents to us.”

Biden campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez identified the Western battlegrounds as one of three swaths in the nation that the president’s reelection bid will hinge upon, in a campaign memo released Tuesday.

The campaign will have more than 40 staff members on the ground in the two states by the end of March, she wrote.

“We’re investing early to reach these voters and highlight the Biden-Harris administration’s work to bring down costs, create good-paying jobs, and keep their families safe — rather than treating them as base voters to engage at the last minute,” Chavez Rodriguez wrote.

On Tuesday, Biden’s campaign announced a new ad focused on Latino voters — delivered in English, Spanglish and Spanish — as well as the launch of Latinos con Biden-Harris, an effort to mobilize Latino voters in the 2024 election.

""You're the reason why in large part I beat Donald Trump,"" Biden told supporters Tuesday evening at El Portal, a Mexican restaurant in Phoenix, who shouted, ""Viva Biden."" ""I need you badly.""

Republicans discounted the effort as too little, too late.

“Democrats have taken the Hispanic community for granted for far too long, and no amount of money the Biden campaign spends will change the fact that Biden and Harris have been a disaster for our community, from the failing economy to the border crisis and the uncontrollable raise of crime in our neighborhoods,” Jaime Florez, the Republican National Committee’s Hispanic outreach and communications director, said in a statement.

“Republicans will continue receiving with open arms thousands of Hispanics that are moving to our party, disappointed with Democrats and their policies, and will be fundamental to Republican victories all over the country in 2024.""

The Biden campaign also focused on union jobs created since the pandemic gutted employment, a particularly salient point in Nevada.

The state’s tourism industry was decimated by the 2020 COVID-19 shutdowns and hasn’t fully recovered. Historically, labor has been an enormous booster of Democrats in the state, and more than one in 10 workers was were a member of a union in 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Supporters repeatedly called Biden “the most pro-union president in history.”

Among the policy proposals Biden and his campaign highlighted during the trip were a $10,000 tax credit for first-time home buyers, building and renovating more than 2 million homes, expanding the child tax credit and increasing taxes on the wealthy.

Biden also twice touted a high-speed rail project that will connect Las Vegas with Southern California, funded by billions of federal dollars.

“Guess what?” he told supporters at the campaign event in Reno.

"Top Latina advocates decry Trump’s ‘not people’ comments
",https://www.yahoo.com/news/top-latina-advocates-decry-trump-195918037.html,"A coalition of advocacy, labor and civil rights groups led by Latinas is condemning former President Trump’s escalating rhetoric against immigrants, arguing words like his contribute to the incitement of hate crimes.

In a joint statement Wednesday, the Latina leaders sought to shake off the normalization of language that’s become part of the mainstream political discourse over the past decade — in large part because of Trump’s political successes.

“Trump’s continuous use of language that devalues the humanity of immigrants is a threat to our democracy and the core of who we are as a nation. This is the same rhetoric that he used to summon a violent mob on January 6 and then recklessly directed them to attack the U.S. Capitol,” said Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of America’s Voice, a progressive immigration policy group.

“It’s also the same dehumanization of immigrants that has inspired domestic terrorist attacks like the mass murders at an El Paso Walmart, Buffalo grocery store, and a Pittsburgh synagogue. We cannot become numb to the fact that a major candidate for president relies on lies and dehumanizing immigrants and calls to violence as the bedrock of his campaign.”

Cárdenas was joined by a who’s who of Latina political leadership, including Lorella Praeli, co-president of Community Change Action; Bruna Sollod, senior political director at United We Dream Action; Kica Matos, president of the NILC Immigrant Justice Fund; Maria Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of Voto Latino; and Rocio Sáenz, executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU).

The six Latinas were joined by Lindsay Schubiner, director of programs at Western States Strategies, the political arm of the Western States Center, an anti-hate nonprofit.

The seven women released the joint statement in response to Trump’s speech over the weekend, where he claimed that if he didn’t get elected, “it’s going to be a blood bath for the country,” while speaking about the auto industry.

Trump also reiterated his false claims that some countries in the Western Hemisphere are emptying prisons and mental hospitals and sending the former inmates on the migrant trail.

“I don’t know if you call them ‘people,’ in some cases,” Trump said in Ohio. “They’re not people, in my opinion.”

He also referred to some migrants as “animals.”

“Trump’s abhorrent and dehumanizing words against immigrants are a clear preview of what we can expect should he return to power: extreme, barbaric treatment of immigrants along with anyone suspected of being an immigrant,” said Matos.

The Trump campaign is not denying the former president’s intent to dehumanize certain categories of immigrants — it’s doubling down.

“President Trump was referring to violent illegal criminals, savage murderers like the one who brutally slaughtered Laken Riley, and MS-13 Gang Members — and most Americans would agree these vicious monsters do not deserve to be humanized,” Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung told The Hill in an email.

Republicans, spurred by Trump, have raised Riley’s slaying as a political banner, using the individual crime to make a case against a broader swath of immigrants.

Trump’s willingness to challenge societal norms on immigration rhetoric — already part of the core of his political career — has ballooned as it’s become clear that border security is President Biden’s most obvious political liability.

“It is appalling that Joe Biden cares more about illegal immigrant criminals than American citizens and spends more time apologizing for calling them illegal than apologizing to Americans for the damage they are inflicting on our country,” wrote Cheung.

“Biden allows illegals to invade our border, uses hardworking Americans’ tax dollars to fly them around the country, and releases them from custody after they commit more crimes. President Trump will secure the southern border and deport illegal criminals to protect ALL American citizens.”

That language — rife with decontextualized claims and at times outright falsehoods — is precisely the point, according to the seven women.

“Dehumanizing and violent rhetoric is deeply dangerous — for our communities from El Paso to Pittsburgh to Buffalo, and for our democracy,” said Schubiner, referring to the three bigotry-driven mass murders that collectively claimed 54 lives.

“Trump has led the normalization of bigotry and violence in our politics, but each and every one of our leaders has the responsibility to push back vocally. Trump’s words are a threat to immigrant communities, and they are a threat to the electoral process. We must take him at his word, and take action so that his vision does not become reality.”

The group of advocates holds significant sway in Latino communities, including some that could prove decisive in November.

“Our members, many of whom are immigrants, work across all sectors of the economy. They’re the essential janitors who clean the buildings we work in, the doctors and nurses who take care of us when we’re sick, and the home care workers who help our aging loved ones and those with disabilities,” said Sáenz, whose SEIU is a key component of voter mobilization efforts in swing states like Nevada.

“Come November, hard working Americans — Black, brown, white, immigrant — will take their demands for good union jobs from the strike lines to the ballot box in 2024 and will do everything in our power to keep Trump and MAGA Republicans from having the last word on who they consider to be ‘people’. We will use our anger and frustration to make real change and elect leaders who will keep all families safe.”

Trump’s enemies are as fired up by his immigration rhetoric as his most ardent supporters.

Democratic political strategists are looking to magnify the dangers behind Trump’s message — though perhaps not the message itself — to energize voters ahead of an election between two unpopular candidates.

“A second term would embolden the MAGA right to continue threatening immigrants and migrants even more than what we experienced in his first term,” said Praeli.

“The only way we can stop the fear-mongering is by turning out to vote and choosing the direction we want our country to take. A multiracial democracy is possible — and it’s on us to build it.”

According to Sollod, whose group is the country’s largest immigrant-led youth organization, multiracial democracy would be at risk in a second Trump presidency.

“We cannot afford to lose this country and ourselves to this white nationalist playbook, nor can we normalize the racist discrimination, inhumane surveillance, racial profiling, harassment, and detention that our loved ones are experiencing in places like Texas and Florida,” said Sollod.

“We call on all people and elected officials across the country to reject these dangerous, white supremacist positions that pose an existential threat to the lives of immigrants and Black and brown people in this country.”

And Kumar, whose organization is a power player in Latino politics, pointed to Trump’s immigration rhetoric as a liability before a broader electorate.

“Americans are clear on his threat. That’s why we collectively beat him at the ballot box. We rejected his fear-mongering, rage, and chaos. We will do it again. The twice-impeached, four-times indicted former president has no future in our multicultural America,” said Kumar.",3/21/2024,Rafael Bernal,yahoo,"[{""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Buffalo""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Vanessa Cárdenas""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Voto Latino""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Rocio Sáenz""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Western States Strategies""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Bruna Sollod""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Service Employees International Union""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""U.S. Capitol""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Kica Matos""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Western States Center""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Lindsay Schubiner""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""America’s Voice""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Community Change Action""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""blood bath""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Lorella Praeli""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""domestic terrorist attacks""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""NILC Immigrant Justice Fund""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""United We Dream Action""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Trump""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Pittsburgh""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Maria Teresa Kumar""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""mass murders""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""El Paso Walmart""}]",0.43
"Biden Team Names 'Most Insane Thing' Trump's Ever Said
",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-trump-most-insane-thing_n_65fb9020e4b06c0f22ebb5df,"President Joe Biden’s campaign team stepped up its meme game on Wednesday by responding to a viral tweet with a reminder about Donald Trump.

The campaign’s rapid response feed retweeted a message on X that asked for “the most insane thing someone has said during an interview.”

Many of the responses included clips from sports, celebrities and other elements of pop culture.

But the Biden-Harris HQ account replied with a clip of Trump from the summer of 2020, during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and before vaccines were available, in which the then-president dismissed the 1,000 Americans dying each day of COVID-19.

",https://edition.cnn.com/2024/03/20/politics/biden-trump-campaign-contrasts/index.html," Joe Biden has been to every top battleground state but one since the Super Tuesday primaries. He has also been on unannounced calls pushing negotiators toward a Gaza ceasefire, among other official White House duties.

Donald Trump has held one rally in a battleground state in those two and a half weeks, and shifted another to Ohio, in part to save on costs. He has also played in two golf tournaments at his Palm Beach golf club, among other activities at his club, like lunches with potential campaign donors that aides feel are about to start paying off big.

The two oldest presidential candidates ever are always touchy about any mention of their own stamina or acuity. And they’re each eager to take shots at the other about who’s sleepy and who can keep up.

But the two weeks since they essentially wrapped up their nominations show very different bets being placed so far – and the very different challenges they face.

Already this year, both men have shown reason to doubt the value of traditional campaigning: Biden won the New Hampshire primary as a write-in candidate while refusing to visit because of a dispute with the state over the timing of its election. Trump steamrolled his opposition despite being the candidate who spent the least time on the ground.

With two candidates this well known in a country more polarized than ever, no one knows how much campaigning will matter this year, especially with political operatives across the spectrum trying to figure out what tactics still work post-pandemic.

But the contrast in the past two weeks has been stark.

Biden is in the midst of his most intense period of in-person campaigning since before Covid-19 shut down the 2020 primaries, just as he was clinching the Democratic nomination four years ago. He’s on a post-State of the Union sprint that will culminate with a fundraiser at Radio City Music Hall in New York next week, where former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama are expected to help him pull off what several involved believe may become the single biggest fundraising event ever.

For Biden, all this activity is a very deliberate flex, designed to build off his hard-swinging State of the Union address as a way of allaying concerns among majorities of voters – and many Democratic leaders themselves – that he is not up to a second term.

Aside from his ongoing court appearances, which he’s chosen to make, Trump has remained almost entirely behind closed doors in Palm Beach, trying to drum up his lagging campaign fundraising and strategize about how to pay the $454 million bond he’s been ordered to pay after the judge in his New York civil fraud trial found that he and his company had lied about their assets for years.

After months of the president being attacked for his light schedule, Biden’s aides are eager to point out the contrast.

“Calling whatever Donald Trump is doing a ‘campaign’ might be generous, because hiding at his country club while calling for cuts to Social Security or calling into white supremacist radio hosts to spew antisemitic stereotypes isn’t exactly an effort to reach the hearts and minds of the American people,” said Biden campaign spokesman Ammar Moussa.

That’s left Trump aides trying to pull apart the appearances Biden has been making, like on Wednesday when campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung issued a statement accusing the president of being “bored” in the middle of an Arizona event. In the latest attempt to portray Biden as senile, Cheung said he was “distracted by a mother and her baby. He isn’t all there, folks!”

Biden explained when he got to the microphone that he had been drawn in by a baby in the crowd.

“Well, folks, I have to tell you straight up: I like y’all, but I couldn’t resist that little baby,” he said.

Contrast over presidential trappings
With a current and former president running against each other for the first time since 1892, every part of both their campaign schedules has at least a tinge of official duties. For the better part of a year, Biden’s trips to tout new projects funded by the government have very conveniently been almost entirely in battleground states, and when he lands he comes with all the trappings of Air Force One. Trump has often tried to keep up presidential appearances of his own on the private jet that he and aides like to call “Trump Force One.”

Sometimes that has put them in parallel spots – like when they both made trips to the Mexican border at the end of February. But in the past two weeks, they have also leaned into their statesman sway with foreign leaders they have invited to see them.

Biden has hosted the president of Poland at the White House to reinvigorate the case for more funding to Ukraine, and he turned the traditional St. Patrick’s Day welcoming of the Irish taoiseach last weekend into an afternoonlong fete. Trump hosted Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán at his Mar-a-Lago home, which sources described as a friendly meeting that ended with Trump praising the authoritarian to members of his Mar-a-Lago club at a tribute concert.

White House aides point out that Biden’s public schedule only captures a fraction of what he is doing each day, with one source familiar saying that he has continued to be very deep in the details on issues ranging from policy proposals in the State of the Union to sorting through personnel. Even out on the campaign trail, said one source familiar, he is still reviewing a thick briefing book each evening and coming back with questions. Another pointed out that Biden, after prepping late into the night for days,  stayed so late greeting lawmakers after the State of the Union that the lights in the House chamber started to be turned off.

“He basically now has two jobs and he used to just have one – and that was a pretty big job,” a Biden adviser said.

“There are a lot of people who can’t keep up with Joe Biden,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement.

The “events” page of Trump’s campaign site is currently empty, with a note reading, “No events scheduled.”

Trump’s days: donor meetings, golf tournaments, trial dates
Trump aides say his schedule has been jumbled by the number of court appearances he’s been making across his many trials – appearances, it should be noted, that are not mandated by the courts. After spending one day last week in court in Florida in his trial over hoarding classified documents, next Monday was supposed to be the first day of the New York trial related to hush money payments to an adult film actress. Trump was slated to attend, but after the judge delayed the trial, he will instead attend a related hearing in Manhattan that day.

After officially securing the Republican nomination on March 12, Trump held one rally in Georgia and one in Ohio to campaign for Senate candidate Bernie Moreno ahead of the primary. Trump doesn’t feel in any danger of losing a state that he won by 8 points in both 2016 and 2020, but sources involved with the campaign told CNN they worried about a potential embarrassment had his endorsed candidate lost the primary. (Moreno won Tuesday night.)

Trump’s days are largely spent on the golf course at Trump International, where he competed in the Club Championship last week, mingled with members, and has occasionally been hosting donors and allies for lunch. He has played golf at least one other time in that period, though usually not with those he’s hitting up for campaign cash. “His golf is too sacred” for that, one person told CNN.

But he has spent many recent evenings hosting donors for dinner at his Mar-a-Lago club, as well as attending various private events at the resort, including a fundraiser for the Palm Beach County Republican Party and a member’s wedding.

Trump’s advisers have insisted that the lull in the campaign trail was a reset before they launch into the general election. But they acknowledge there was a definite need to spend time fundraising and courting donors. Many on Trump’s team expressed a feeling of relief in recent days, however, after his securing of the nomination was met with signed checks from Republican donors.

Battling it out in battleground states
Biden goes to Pennsylvania – which he flipped from Trump in 2020 – so often that it’s become a joke among reporters and an occasional annoyance to local Democratic leaders who have had to choose between upending their schedules to be with him or answering for why they stood him up. Trump has been to the state once this year, for a National Rifle Association convention in Harrisburg at the beginning of February. Before that, he was last there for a rally in Erie in the fall. And while advisers insist he will be prioritizing the state ahead of November, there is nothing currently on the schedule.

The contrast is even starker in Wisconsin – another state that swung from Trump to Biden. Vice President Kamala Harris recently visited a home in Madison where she had lived for a few years as a child and talked about how she always felt connected to the state. And Biden was in Milwaukee last week to announce $36 million for a new bridge, open a campaign office and spend the night. Before that, he was last there in January to announce funding for a different bridge that connects part of the state to Minnesota, also drawn from the infrastructure law funding.

Trump’s last visit to the state: August 5, 2022.

Even leading Wisconsin Democrats have been surprised when told how long ago Trump’s last visit was.

“In the 2020 election cycle, Trump visited Wisconsin 16 times. Then he lost, his favorite candidate for governor lost, and his favorite candidate for Supreme Court lost in a landslide,” said Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler. “Now, since August of 2022, Trump has visited Wisconsin zero times. To quote the classic film ‘Dodgeball,’ it’s a bold strategy. Let’s see if it pays off for him.”

On Wednesday, Biden was in Arizona to announce $8.5 billion going toward a new Intel chip processing plant outside of Phoenix, returning to a state he visited twice in the second half of last year. Trump had been looking at a trip to the state – which went for Biden by just 10,457 votes in 2020 – for last weekend, the same day as his Ohio rally. But those plans were scrapped after clinching the presidential nomination, with two sources citing a desire to save money and attend a more politically advantageous event in Ohio rallying for Moreno.

But that means that Trump’s last trip to Arizona remains October 9, 2022.

People involved in the planning say Trump is expected to be back on the campaign trail within the next two weeks, with likely stops in targeted battleground states. Aides have also been looking at a wider strategy of deploying top officials and other surrogates as they wait for him to make a decision on a running mate.

And Trump intends to stage a mix of events where Republican officials and other dignitaries come to him, either at his Mar-a-Lago resort or during his summer stay in Bedminster, New Jersey, a Trump adviser says, as well as trips to battleground states.

Gaming out media coverage
Trump has never needed to board an airplane to fill the void.

Though he has conducted all of his recent interviews from Mar-a-Lago with largely sympathetic media, many of his public statements have kept him in the news through cycles of outrage he is an expert in riding out. His growing number of legal battles – with indictments and hearings and trial appearances – have also kept him in the spotlight, filling hours of unpaid media.

Biden is counting on getting a bump from local press coverage as he pops into states to announce new funding and projects. He has done more interviews than Trump, though because they have been with local media and have provoked less outrage, they have not generated the same kind of attention.

But he’s looking to step that up some. Biden has asked senior aides to give him a running list of Trump’s extreme comments, according to a source close to the campaign, and will inject new criticism into his stump in real time. Among the examples cited by the person: Trump’s claims that immigrants are poisoning the blood of Americans, his suggestions about cutting Social Security and his praise for authoritarians.",3/21/2024,Edward-Isaac Dovere and Kristen Holmes,CNN,"[{""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""Democratic""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""presidential candidates""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Gaza""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Palm Beach""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""New York""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Super Tuesday primaries""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Ohio""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""2020 primaries""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""White House""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""battleground state""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""post-State of the Union""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""Radio City Music Hall""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Barack Obama""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Bill Clinton""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""golf tournaments""}, {""type"": ""location"", ""text"": ""New Hampshire""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Joe Biden""}]",0.53
"Ex-Prosecutor Stunned By Trump's New Legal Claim: 'Doesn't Make Any Sense At All'
",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/andrew-weissmann-donald-trump-money-credit_n_65fc05fae4b01d7420acf0bd,"Former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann said he highly doubted former President Donald Trump’s claim that he’s been unable to obtain a $464 million bond to appeal his civil fraud conviction.

It “just doesn’t make any sense at all,” Weissmann told MSNBC’s Alicia Menendez on Wednesday’s broadcast of “Deadline: White House.”

In a filing to the New York State Supreme Court, Trump called it “a practical impossibility” that he’ll get the money together and said 30 bond companies had turned him down.

But New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the civil case against Trump, fired back in a separate filing by suggesting Trump hadn’t offered appropriate evidence to back up his claims. James also argued the total required could be split up into smaller sums between multiple companies.

Weissmann agreed, adding Trump could also mortgage his assets.

Trump “could do all that” but the “real issue is that he may just be too leveraged,” said Weissmann.

“He says he’s worth so much, but all these properties are used to back loans from other institutions,” he added. “He may not have all that much money, either cash on hand or property that isn’t already pledged for other loans. So the reason he’s having trouble and the reason he might be having this meltdown is he can’t post the money, and he needs a lifeline through some third party who is going to be able to bail him out.”",3/21/2024, Lee Moran,huffpost,"[{""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Donald Trump""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Andrew Weissmann""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""Alicia Menendez""}, {""type"": ""person"", ""text"": ""New York Attorney General Letitia James""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""Deadline: White House""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""civil fraud conviction""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""MSNBC""}, {""type"": ""organization"", ""text"": ""New York State Supreme Court""}, {""type"": ""event"", ""text"": ""meltdown""}]",0.68
"Ex-Trump Aide Says He'd Respond To Bankruptcy In 1 Whining Way: 'I Can Hear It Now'
",https://www.huffpost.com/entry/stephanie-grisham-donald-trump-bankruptcy_n_65fbf204e4b06c0f22ebd701,"Former Trump White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Wednesday said she could envision Donald Trump declaring bankruptcy in a bid to stall the seizure of his assets as the former president struggles to meet the bond to appeal the $464 million damages he owes following his civil fraud trial.

CNN’s “OutFront” anchor Erin Burnett noted how the presumptive GOP nominee had “built his entire candidacy, his political career about being this billionaire, successful businessman” and asked Grisham whether he’d be willing to declare bankruptcy so close to the 2024 election, given the negative message it may send to voters. Trump has done so on multiple previous occasions.

“I do,” replied Grisham.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the civil case agonist Trump and his business, can next week begin the process of seizing his assets.

Grisham suggested that “rather than lose Trump Tower, Mar-a-Lago or Bedminster, those top three for sure, he would declare bankruptcy.”

Trump will then “lean into it,” she predicted.


“Privately, will he like it? No, he’ll hate it,” Grisham said. “But he’ll lean into it and say ‘This is what I was forced to do,’ ‘This is because of the left wing,’ ‘This is because of the New York liberals, they’re doing this to me,’ ‘This is just a business move to protect myself.’”

“I can hear it now,” said Grisham. “He won’t like it personally, but I can absolutely see him doing that.”

Grisham later suggested Trump, if he wins the 2024 election, may be able to reverse the move.

"Susan Rice Sounds The Alarm On How Donald Trump’s Debts Could Risk U.S. Security

Trump owes “some $500 million or more,” is struggling to meet the bond in his $464 million fraud ruling and so “you have to wonder where he’s going to get that money from,” the Obama White House official told MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell.

“In the event that [Trump] has to take that money from an individual or an entity, whether domestic or international, that individual or entity will potentially have real influence over him and so that is of concern” if he returns to the White House, said Rice.

Rice noted Trump’s “long history of foreign financial entanglements” and warned, “There’s just so many ways the stench of money from dubious places infuses his business enterprise and so this would add more questions should that be the case going forward.”
